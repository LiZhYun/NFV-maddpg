When I was 11 years old, I was welcomed by the sounds of kindness of kindness in one morning.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual back then, because the news was often depressing.
He said, "The Taliban are gone."
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned going to school.
So I spent five years committing myself as a boy, and my older sister, who had no way to go alone, to a secret school.
So we could go to school only like this.
Every day, we took another path, so nobody could guess where we were going.
We're hiding our books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of nice, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and every time, the class had to be attacked for a week because the Taliban had been spotted.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to tell us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was valued and valued and separated.
My grandfather was way ahead of his time.
A foreign stranger from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
My mother-educated mother, she became a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- seeing here -- was the first person in his family who ever got an education.
For him, he was always realized that his children would be able to get education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He saw it as a much greater risk to not send his children to school.
I remember, in the years, I was so frustrated, sometimes by the Taliban, by our lives, by the constant fear and the side-of-sextinction.
I was having a good joke to give up, but my father said, "You can listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be distributed from your home in war.
But one thing is, you're going to stay: what's inside of it. And even if we're going to pay for your blood for your school fees, we're going to do that.
So -- do you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have higher degree than a high school degree, and if my family hadn't been used so much for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proud unoffentine of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first to congratulate me.
He's not just a senior degree, but also to say that I was the first woman and I'm the car ride through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more and more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've been helping to start SOLA, the first and perhaps the only boarding department for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls' school school school is still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students at my school want to be more attentive to all of them to have provided opportunity.
And seeing their parents and fathers standing for them, as well as my parents were then, despite the face of the conflict against the worse.
Like Ahmed Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is a father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home from SOLA to her village, and they were the death from a bomb on the side of the road, just for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rings, and a voice beats him, if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.
He said this one: "Take me now if you want to sing, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on play because of your aging and over-reviewing imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've seen something that is often left in the West: behind most of us who have succeeded, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that's what she's succeeds.
That's not to say that our mothers are not going to matter in our success.
They're often the ones that are often reviserentized and persuasive for their daughters' future, but in a society like Afghanistan, women are essential to support.
And under the Taliban, a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, more than three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, so different.
Americans recognize how unsafe these changes are.
I'm afraid that changing changes are not longer over time and are changing with the U.S. troops.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them for them, I see a promising future and a lasting change.
Afghanistan, for me, is a country of hope and the unlimited possibility, and every day, I remember the girls coming to the SOLA.
Just like me, they have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even professionally -- my life -- was coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977, I look young, I don't -- -- I've -- in Zambia, Kenya, ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, projects on the tech world with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on our legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years was that we were Italian people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples of the Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people of Italy to be the people of Sambia to be growing food.
We went to the Southeast with Italian seed, in this elaborate valley, which leads to Samati River, and we taught the local population to grow Italian tomato and mcini, and --
Of course, the local members had absolutely no interest in this, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they popped up.
We were amazed that there was no agricultural waste in this fertile valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Make even in time to save the people of Sambia before the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderfully invested in Africa.
We had this gorgeous tomato. In Italy, they were so big, so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the guhalers, "Look how simple agriculture is."
When the tomato was ripe and red, over the night, about 200 noders came out of the river and diked everything.
We said to the Himalayan novels, "Oh God, the fier!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have farming here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were Italian-talky in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French did, and after I saw what they did, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the nemies.
You should see the nonsense -- -- -- you should see the nonsense that we've given to the unknown African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a peer-American economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We Dutch countries have given the African continent a trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has taken.
Just read her book.
Read about a African man, what we've been doing.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways that we deal with people. We locate them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchical: I treat any other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisind: I treat any other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bug," the boss.
I was shakened when I read the book "sall' Beautiful" by "suppers. He said, most importantly, in economics, if people don't want help, they leave you alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolatial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just respond to people and create a system called business promotion, where no one ever gets started, nobody will be motivated, but you will be the CEO of the local passion worker, the servant of the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you keep your mouth.
You never get to a community with ideas, you put them together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in kitchets.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to close up with friends and figure out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like this person, what do you want to do?
The passion for the growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important of humanity.
We're helping them find knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why, instead of going into a community and saying to people what they should do, why don't we listen to them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
Entrepreneurs never have a participant, and they will never say public what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Design has this flower spot.
The brightest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to public meetings.
We're working on one to do that, we need to be built a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job needs to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the shopman who's sitting with you in the house, sitting in your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way that transform your life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was a Ph.D. student, and I was trying to get out of the rapty flaws, where we tell others what to do.
And so the first year I was walking around the streets, and within the first three days, I had my first client. I helped him. He was a big fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell to a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen came in, and they said, "You helped the maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers to work together and not selling this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents. Milo, but to Japan for sushi for 15 dollars. Cilo. Then farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I keep the mouth and I listen to them."
So <unk> <unk> <unk> So the government says, "Let me do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that are coming to loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business advisers of history, died at 96 years ago.
Peter Cochrane was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter's CPU said, "Aid is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch without knowing what the smartest human man Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to you.
You have to provide them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to come in.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What presentation did you most cheated for tomorrow?
<unk>uite passionate people. You hated them.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- the anti-fueling fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are unsustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open species of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in a sustainable way, to build and channel them with them.
The technologies are not there.
Who's going to invent this technology for the green revolution? Do universities? Forget it.
The government? Forget it.
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and I mapped what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York. The conclusion was, the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grew up at the speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get their shit off six million horses.
Because they were already going in crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that makes life go from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, in the United States, there were 1001 automotive makers -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race, there were little factories in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First, they need to be offered discretionion.
Otherwise, they don't come and they're speaking to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all needs to be able to perform three things: to sell the capital company, to be great, to be grand, and to be enormous.
So guess what?
We never met a single person who can also produce something, sell and take care of the money.
It doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iconiest companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have said, one thing only is that no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 years of business entrepreneurs in Northeast, and we start giving them the first two pages of Richard Bransons Autobiography, and the job of the 16-year-old children is to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons's Autography, how many times they use the word "mich" and often the word "we"
Never "I" and 32 times "we" again.
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where a facilitator who has a small professional background, a coffee band and a bars. They're their dedicated buddy, who are going to do what someone did for this gentleman who's talking about this seminar. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting corporate experts to help them find the means and to find people. We've found that the wonders of the local population can change the culture and the economy of this community, only by opening the passion, energy and imagination of the people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be Alice's miracles.
Penn State University asked me -- a faculty for communication -- to share instruction with the engineers in communication.
I was scared.
Really fear. Fear of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big books, I don't trust them.
But when the conversation developed, he took me like Alice, when she got down to the pig's pig's car and saw a door to a new world.
I also felt like I was doing conversations with the students, and I was amazed by the idea they had and wanted others to find these wonderful heritage.
I think to open up these door, it requires great communication.
We need some great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy, environment and health, and if we don't know about it, it's not going to go anywhere. I believe that it's in our responsibility as a non-religist, these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
I'm going to show you a couple of attempts for how you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well, what?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only does your body flies study, but also tell us that their stomachs, the pillody structure in our bones, are examined because it's important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And if you're going to describe what you're doing, then you're not going to be able to get the dictionary out.
Now, the dictionary is a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use "discover" and time, but why don't you just say "play and time," what is a lot more perceptual to us?
And to make your mind understand is not the same as they're at the level.
As Einstein said before, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to compete.
So a couple of things are related to this: examples, stories and analogies. That's how you can get us into your bif.
And when you present your work, the dots are coming away.
Have you ever asked, why is it the point of view?
What happens when someone looks at you? One is getting stabbed, and those dots are your audience first.
A slide like this is not only boring, but it also fits too much on the conversation-making part of our brain, and by doing so, we're very much more excited.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more potent. It shows that the specific structure of the spine is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple, transparent sentence where the audience can react to the thread once it loses, use images and graphics that also inform our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a couple of ways that we can help us open up the door and see the wonders that science and technology can be addressed.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been trained to connect with the "Larhead in me" -- I want to sum up everything with a equation.
So, from your science, your reference points and your logs, they share them through the relevance, so the audience tells you what's important, and they multiply the passion that you have for the incredible work, and that creates incredible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you've solved this equation, I'm really focused on it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and provide a personal freedom.
With a phone, you can film a crime in the country of humanity.
You can tweet a message with a phone. You can start a protest in Egypt.
And with a phone, you can take a song and you can get it up on sound cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Berlin in 1904, and I live in Berlin.
So let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people were coming out of the road and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're imagining that all these people who were coming together and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, my cell phone wants to talk about me and my phone about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines of information.
We have raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.F. led a policy.
This is a policy changer for law enforcement management.
This policy is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in Europe has to store a range of user information.
Who's calling who? Who's going to send an email?
Who's going to send text messages to you?
And if you use a phone, where you are.
All this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service providers.
And all over Europe, people have been up and said, "We don't want to do that."
They said, we don't want to have this reserve protection.
We want self-determons in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of whom said, "We don't want that."
And here you can see tens of thousands of people streaming on the streets of Berlin, saying, "Freedom instead of fear."
And some even said this could be a St. 2.0.
The Stors was the Teimpol policei in eastern Germany.
And I'm also wondering, is this really working?
Can all this information really store us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Declagina Telecom, who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, I'll send all the information you've stored on me.
And I asked her one time, and I asked her again, and I didn't get a right answer. Only a half-square- Bla.
But then I told myself I wanted to have this information, because it's my life that you're doing this.
So I decided to set up a court process against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German news said no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
And at the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to take the message back, which they're going to send me all the information that they're asking me.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court mandate decided that the E.U. was a corruption-based response.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 lines of information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said to myself, well, it's a huge file. My approach.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what should I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is the law enforcement capacity.
So with time online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and down.
You can track every step that I make.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to Köln, and how many calls I'm going to go.
All of this is possible by this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a couple of times.
And then a couple of friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up, and you call up, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, what time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a design plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who is talking to who to whom to send an email, all of that is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months, in Europe, up to two years.
As I said in the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi had known who the leaders were, it might have never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, perhaps it wouldn't have happened.
And again, not the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it for a long time.
But self-determin and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for your own right now.
They have to fight for it every day.
So when you go home, you're telling your friends that privacy is the 21st century value, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, you're going to tell your neighbors, just because companies and state countries have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it yet.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information that they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your phone, remember that you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiral shops, speed restaurants, bruntops.
So the city planner is making a decision, and they're thinking about changing the name of South Central, so that it's for something else, and they're changing it in South Los Angeles, as if that's something that's going wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Immedate bureaucracy, rapid restaurants, bride spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the Drivebys.
The great thing is that the Drive-thrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles for curable diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it is in Beverly Hills, about 15 miles away.
I couldn't catch that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative impacts that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I find that we buy wheelchairs and sell them like the disposal ship.
I see dialoghing centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that we have to stop that.
I understood that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and food is the solution.
And I didn't have any pleasure at 45 minutes' national records to get an apple that's not contactable with pesticides.
So I planted a food deforestation before my house.
It's a piece of land that we call parking lots.
It's 45 to four feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to nurture it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay in.
And I decided to keep it in the state like this.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, together, and we started planting my food raft, and fruit trees, and so the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of executive group, built out of gardening from all the social strips and all the city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically assigned me a planner, and said, I need to get rid of my garden, the supply line became a seduction to a seduction.
And I thought, "Okay, come on, right?
A seductive set of calls for growing food on a piece of land that you're completely not sure?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand with it."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and he spoke to the town, and she and she gave me a member of Green Ground Ground, and she put a petition on Change.org, and with 900 signatures, we were successful.
We kept the victory in our hands.
My town board even called up to me and said they're supporting it and they love what we're doing.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most real estate spaces in the United States in the community.
They have 4,200 square miles on the bride.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should they not find that OK?
By planting a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my treasure message, I'm telling people to grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing their own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew my sons there.
And I'm more happy to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Homework is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's been committing walls, I'm going to fill lawns and plant equipment.
I'm using the garden, the earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my grading for this stuff.
You would be surprised what the ground Earth can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my backyard as my garden became an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the soil.
You would wonder how children are influenced by this.
So gardening is the most therapeutic and most bold act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you can also get strawberry strawberry.
I remember that time that this time, when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my garden, and I came out and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not for no reason in the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just empowered me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum devil, no, I'm not afraid they're going to make a shit.
And that's what it's like in the street.
Now, that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back to their health."
And at another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who have helped me fleet the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they've planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it has changed, even if it's just for a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people come and they were doing it, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, they eat child carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they're not offered anything about it, if they're not shown, how they're affecting the lives of food and bodies, they're blind, whatever they're subjected to.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that they were looking for, and that leads nowhere to them.
I see the gardening as an opportunity to train these children to take care of their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could bring George Washington Carver the next George Washingtonver.
But if we don't change the composition of the soil, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipping container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free shit, because free is not sustainable.
The great thing about sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work, and bringing children from the streets, and letting them experience the pride and honor and honor when you build their own food, and when you open farmers' markets.
So, what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want us to become all environmental rebel, gangster, gang gardener.
We need to turn the picture of the gait.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
The gang is, you know, you're going to be a hammill, right?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're going to sit in the web and do a meeting where you're talking about doing some shit.
If you want to meet me, you come with your sho, you get to my backyard so that we can plant some shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "snollygoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "snollygoster" means "tolerable politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher gave a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who is willing to follow a party, no matter what a party, program or performance, and succeeds by the sheer power of the monumental acoustic bias."
I have no idea what the "turning" is.
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the heart of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, the British Parliament, the British Parliament, were not able to discuss the exact word of the debates that they were debated.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who went with Parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it to him, but he was courageous, he was brave enough to fight, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for "so" as well as Brass." Many people think.
Brass is a local word for the green.
But that's not true. It's coming back to a people who are lawyers of the press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time that it has just reached independence.
You'd look at the question of, how to call George Washington, the head of state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a bankrupt nation?
and it was debated in Congress for a long time.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-city George Washington, and others, and the regulators of the freedom of the people of America from America in Washington.
Not that special.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that was possible.
They weren't monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with enough lengths because this debate was held three weeks.
I read the diary book of a Senate that constantly writes, "On the same topic."
The reason that we've done the stakes, and the boredom was that the live room was against the Senate.
The representment house didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want it to be.
King call it, and maybe even give him ideas to follow.
They wanted to give him the most humbling, most disseading title, which they thought they were.
This title was "The Princeor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only believed that someone had a gathering.
It's kind of like the pre-eath of a jury.
He had no longer been the size of the record as a "compassion" or "compassion."
Sometimes there were a couple of head-in-owned leaders and government groups, but it was really a misguided title.
That's why the Senate refused to leave him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it to President.
This guy has to sign up agreements and meet foreign vigars.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't go.
Instead, you'd have a sense of what it would be like to be the "diction of the State," but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they were not helpful to believe in the opinions and civilized nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, where it's meant to be the Center of the state of government, not necessarily compatible with the presidency, and that the United States, the United States, the foreign government,
You can learn three interesting things from this.
First, I think that's the best way -- I couldn't figure out if the Senate ever put the title to the president in the same way.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just hated the title. He just waits to the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something is temporary -- -- you're going to wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the "Amdiction of the United States of America" today doesn't sound so humbling, right?
It has to do with the kind of 5,000-carbon-bastry coral race that it has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title of size.
And that's how the Senate ended.
They got a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the supposed of indigness -- well, it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
Four-7.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the day, the Senate won, and the representation of the house, because nobody feels humbling when you're told that you're the president of the United States today.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and that's what I'm going to leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the words change much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I got to a Lint, about 50 Rebel to the fight for jalalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to wipe my black Converse half shoes against a pair of brown leatherters and a rocket towards the government host, which I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time before, I'd been a big war, but I'd been a little bit of a new call by Pyjama party and a football game and aimship of Southeast countries and heroics that never had a referring to the communism and a lot of Afghanistan, and I've never known that that this was true.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, a more inspired Afghans, Southeast of God Gnaden. An atheist and a radical political artist who has been working in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So, in Afghanistan, there's a lot of great things about how to make art, but I personally don't like to paint rainwows. I want to make art that compelled the personalities and informs the authority and re-vision the reality and even using a kind of imaginative citizenship to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- lobster, leading its jihad against communist, like "Popheading" and using armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihadiest thing as to do for the parliament and to do a campaign with the phrase, "Take me! I'm jihad, and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to disappoint these mafiosi that are used as a national hero.
I want to go to corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "reachstations," where you're a policeman, build a false control position on the streets of Kabul, and keep cars on the streets of Kabul, but instead of taking bribes from them, providing money, and giving them permission to the name of Kabul, and they hope they're going to take us 100 dollars.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my opinion, a new-looking conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only catch using a pioneering for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine the fur of local Afghan people with a protective clothing, or several apartments into a moderate, green-towning vine.
And I'd like to see what a simple pusher looks like from Kabul from Kiplello, from 1899 to create a dialogue about how modern development institutions are going to have its roots in history about "The Great Beet of Djord" to protect the brown man from themselves and maybe even to devin a few civilians.
But for all these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood.
But I do, because I have to because the geography of self requires it.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for some time, I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, I've said, really.
I feel like I've grown up here in the room now, in a way that I don't have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I have something to do with change.
This is the first time that someone is moving to the TED stage, so you can be happy to see that, I think.
If a few women were really excited when I came out, you don't need me to say this, I'll read it later on on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think of me.
And that's not the chance for everyone to do that.
These tracks are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're going to wake me all, so don't do anything until it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
A image is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never actually had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to go and put my back on my back and put my hand into this guy's hair.
And besides surgeries or the wrong flustles that I took for my work two days ago, there are very few ways to change our utterance, and our utterance -- even though it's superficial and irreversible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but I'm going to ask them in the honest way.
The first question is, how do you become a model?
I'm always saying, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I became a model is a win in the genetic lottery, and an important heritage, and maybe you ask yourself what this legacy is made of.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, where we are biologically compatible, but also as big, pounding, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been offered for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion artists like, "Halt. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smash. Liu."
And first, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious doctor of NYU counted all the modules on the runway, every single person who was being dated, and that from 677 different modules were only 27 or less than four percent of the time they didn't know.
The next question I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model if I grow up?"
And first, I say, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can get anything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja Conacher, which is completely wrong, because then you're the first one."
If you still say after this great interrogation, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who is my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the president of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to become a model later, it's like saying that you want to win the Jackpot in the Lotto.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career path.
Now, I'm going to show you 10 years of digitized model, because otherwise, as a heart surgeon, it can only happen.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice flier, and the client says, "Cameron, we want a picture to run," well, the leg first goes beautiful, long, that arm goes back, this arm is on the front, and the head is three degrees, and you just move back, and you see, you see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and have a walking and done a few jobs, you can't tell much more. If you say that you want to be president of the United States, but in the run, "10 years of underwear." You're looking at weirdness.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who are you saving all the photos?"
And yes, almost all the photos are stored, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I made, and this was the first time I carried a Bikini. I didn't even have my period at that time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the magazine.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party a couple days ago, a magazine for French birdgy.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you'll see that these pictures are not images of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, Hairstylists and remixers and photographers and Stylists and all their fellow pilots and post-programs. They're constructing. That's not me.
Okay, so next thing, people always ask me, "Well, did you fight for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-meter bags I can never carry, except the things I get for free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about them.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
As a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a horrible driver, and she walked over a red light, and of course, we were stopped. It took me a "Excuse me, Mr. Wacht champion," and we could go on.
I got these free things because of my appearance, and I don't think it's because of my personality, and there are people who are looking at their appearance and not paying a lot of money for their personality.
I live in New York, and I live in the 140,000 teens who have been shot and filtered last year, and that's 85 percent of black and Latino, and most of the time, young men.
It's only 177,000 young black black and Latino people living in New York who don't ask the question: Who am I stopping?
It was, "How many times am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
My research came out that 53 percent of all the women in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent when they get 17.
The last question I asked myself is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little bit thinner and you have glittery hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backstage, we'll give a answer that might give you this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring people."
All of that is true, but it's only one half of the story, because what we never say before the camera is what I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I happier if I had little darker legs and glitter hair?"
And then you should meet some mocks, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool puppies that they look at because of their appearance, they're probably the least unsafe women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to get a very honest balance, because one thing I felt really uncomfortable about putting myself in here and saying, "I got all the benefits from a stack that was telled to my favor," and it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was a very difficult thing to do with a heritage of oppression for gender and race, when I'm one of the biggest supplementters of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to be here, and I'm really excited that I've done this here before 10 or 20 years or 30 years of my career is still filled, because I wouldn't probably tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I paid college, which is so important.
If you take a little bit out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our supposed successes and failures more.
Thank you.
I never forgot my grandmother's words that came to life in exile: "Son, poor Gaddafi resistance. Get it.
But never become something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been now nearly two years since the Libyan revolution has been expanding, inspired by the waves of mass mass mass customization in both the Tunisian revolution.
I joined with many other Libyers, within and outside, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, licic women and men stood in the front row, asking the end of the regime, gave slogans to liberty, dignity and social justice to the air.
They have proved exemplified courage by placing on the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafis.
They have shown a powerful sense of solidarity, from the far east, across the far west, all the way to the south.
Finally, after six months of brutal war and nearly 50,000 dead, we were able to free our country and move over the tyrannics.
But Gaddafi did leave a great servant, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the basis of change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis tyrannic regime has broken both infrastructure and also the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
I realized the devastation and the challenges, as many other women, were growing the civil society of Lybia, and we were asking for a policy-oriented and unchanging transition to democracy and national justice.
Virtally, 200 organizations have been founded during the fall, and immediately after Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to create human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the leadership platform of Libyians, a leadership of women, leaders of various living life, whose goal is to be public for the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and to our right to vote for equal leadership with democracy and peacebuilding.
In the pollaries, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was polarized and stronger, a environment that was defined by selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I led an initiative to the Leadership Council of Bory Women to achieve a policy rule, a law that any citizen, no matter what the back, should be the right to vote and take a stand, and most importantly, to a relationship between political parties and women in the vertical and lower and horizontal and lower and narrow, and to make a complete impact.
At the end, our initiative was taken and succeeded.
Women won 175 percent of the national missionary in the first elections for 52 years.
But, quite frankly, the history of the election and the entire revolution, because every day we made news about violence, we made news about violence.
We were entering a morning to celebrate the march on pre-vise refugees and Sufi leaders.
On another morning, we got a message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack.
And then another morning, the wounded were placed by the army victims.
And we're really waking up every day under the tyranny of militias and their ongoing lives against the human rights and their abortion of laws and laws.
Our society is formed by a revolutionary state of mind, polarized and distant from the ideals and principles -- freedom, social justice -- that they had at the beginning.
Intolerance, decons, and revenge became the icon of the "fol-lime" of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our pressing careers and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to make sure that as a nation, we have made false choices and false decisions.
We've misleted our priorities.
Because elections didn't bring peace or stability or security to lybias.
Has the re-excumbered list and the change between women and male leaders led peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
So what is it?
Why is our society going to keep polarized and dominating politically and purposefully governing both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the complaint.
Our society needs a national dialogue and reconfigurability as it needed the elections that ultimately has strengthened the polarization and reproduction.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female as it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting on behalf of anger and calling a day of revenge.
We need to start acting on behalf of compassion and the mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just claim the following values, but also requires the fact: Goffade instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, without execution.
These are the ideals that need to be fought by war, and they're desperately necessary to reach peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in that alchemy, it's about the relocation of feminine and masking view.
That's the real punch.
And we need to implement that in existential terms before we do it socio-Indically.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam" -- "Lem God the word of the Good God, raping."
The word "raem" again, which is known in all the aboriginal traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rahem" and symbolizes the maternal feminine that surrounds all humanity, from the man-in-the-them and the female, all the tribes and all the peoples have run out.
And just like the mother's abdo growing in him, all around the world offers the basic framework of compassion to the whole existence.
And so we were told, "My Gnade is really all things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade has prefussed before my soal."
I'm going to be a chance to be a good fan of the gum.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up using the song "nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were pushing the story of Kim Ilung, but we were not very much learning about the world out there, except that America, South Korea and Japan are enemies.
Although I often wondered what the outside world was like, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until I had a change-changing time.
At age seven, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from my sister's sister's sister.
And he said, "If you heard this, our five family members of the world will not be on the planet anymore because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people were dying in my country.
Shortly after that, I went past the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A bleeding woman was lying on the ground, and a hand-tipped kid in her arm looked helpless to his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were all engaged in taking care of themselves and their families.
In the mid-1990s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were dying of famine, and many more people survived because they ate grasses, beetles and tree trunks.
So electricityfalls have become more and more and more abundant, so that at night, everything around me was too much worse, except for the lights of China on the other side of the tag that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't have lights.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the amrips, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very high-sicial, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of deaths.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that during the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China to the remote relatives.
I just thought that for a short time, I would be separated from my family.
I never thought it would take me 14 years to work together.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have any idea of what life would be like as a North Korean refugee, but soon I realized that it's not only incredibly difficult, but also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in silence for my true identity to fly, and you'd be me back to a terrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was realized when I was caught by the Chinese Police Service and sent to the police department.
Somebody gave me a sense of being a North Korean woman, so they tested my Chinese convictions and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid I thought my heart would explode.
If anything is unnatural, I could be imprisoned and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the polling, a senior official said to the other, "This was a falcon.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are using foreign messages in China, likeyl, but many are caught by the Chinese police, and they are rejected.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they were caught, they were finally released from immense international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have that much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are released to North Korea, where they are tortured, imprisoned or imprisoned in public.
Although I was fortunate enough to escape, many other North Koreans don't go like that.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle for their survival.
After they've learned a new language and they've found a new language, their world can be put on their heads in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life again.
In South Korea, I was left with a bigger challenge than I would have thought.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And I've also seen the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very divergent from the front of 67 years, because of the division of this.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northanan?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the adaptation to the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show of the university.
Just as I got better than my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities started the money I was sending my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to go to a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go through an incredible route on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, ironically, I took a flight back to China and I moved to the north Korean border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run them, I had to run them for more than 2,000 miles through China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand a Chinese man, I thought they were going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed, and told him they were a shower, and I was her lock, and I was her connotable.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get it to the low-degree border, but I had to try to get almost all my money to get the border control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family has been imprisoned because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and paid for a bribe, my family was released within a month, but shortly after, my family was rebuilt, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest disincussions of my life.
I had done everything to protect my family to freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went back and forth between the foreign authorities and the police department, trying to get rid of my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back the bribe or money launderer.
I lost all my hope.
And the guy asked me, "What's the voice?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is taking care of it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without roaring, he went to a bank machine, and he paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get it out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger, for me, symbolized a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope-fong, that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back together in South Korea, but the freedom to gain is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn education, learning English, professional education, many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family workers, and we're sending them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to have hope to thrive North Koreans with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big, and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He's unconditional about it, and he's going to split it down.
It's not a pity. It doesn't look at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to think of words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: How little we know about minds and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It has absolutely unfinished memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate card, but he remembers every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while he was the first episode of the teapadies on my arm, and he put a lady named Gagas birthday.
Don't you listen to me as amazing as you can?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and understood wrong.
But what encouraged my heart and strengthening my soul was that even though that was the case, although they were not seen as usual, that only one would mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex disorder in the brain that affect social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It's different from each individual, and that's why Remi is different from Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes is noticed of autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm confronted with autism, but I can't remember it every day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He screamed a lot.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, putting the washing machine in a row and eating everything that was under it.
And as he grew older, he became different, and the differences became more visible.
But behind the rage and the raver, and the ultimate hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been lied.
Remarkable.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wished they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normal, the beauty that we have is the differences that give us, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift. Each of us has a gift in them. And in all fairness, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment we try to become like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been faked us with awe and curiosity, and this photo on this photo, he's releasing an apple and a cat-surpainted moment from just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we see the world not with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femtoemto photography, a new engineering technique that's so fast to make it a slow motion of light.
And so we can build cameras that are beyond our viewpoints of our view, or even without a <unk>-ray in our body and really ask what we mean with "Kamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it into a billionth of a second -- these are several femtoseconds -- I'll make a package of photons that are barely a millimeter wide, and this photon pack, this project, is going to move in speed, and I'll say, a million times faster than a normal project.
So, if you take this project, this photon pack and you shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event.
So remember, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotone -- as long as the light to go back this lane -- but I'm trying to make this video take about 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, this movie is happening a lot, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, is going to enter the bottle with a photon package that starts to move through and eventually breaks in.
Part of the light goes outwards to the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the blood flow and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble there that's sweeping around in the bottle.
And meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflective features from above, you see the reflection at the end of the bottle are focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and we're going to take it back the same route and slow it back to the factor 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
One day, one week? No, a year.
That would be a very boring movie -- -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a still-life photographer?
You can see again how these waves of the table are flipping the Tomate and the wall in the background.
It's like throwing a rock in a pond.
It seemed to me as if nature was painting a photo like this, each one of the trerto image, but of course our eye is a compost of a compartment.
But if you look at this Tomate again, you'll see that when the light goes over the Tomate, it's going to stay alive. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomate has arrived and the light is going to be going in the air after a few billionth of a second.
So, in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it might be possible that you could go into a supermarket and see if a fruit is mature without touching it.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with a brief catastlime, you have very little light, but we're more targeted a billion times faster than your shortest habitat, so you're not getting anything as good as any light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon pack, a multi-million-and-half-half-four and we're drawing it again with very clever synchronization, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and make some interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make themselves invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superheroes: to see corners?
The idea is that we're turning a little bit of light on the door.
It will be fluffed into space, and some of it will be reflected back to the door, and eventually we could use this more and more maneuverable of light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually made it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is a puppet is hidden, and we're going to let the light go off the door.
After our paper was published in the International Communications journal, it was taken by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light-frogging, and they're going to be poured into this wall, and this photon pack is being poured into all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light, and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but they're going to be very interesting at the same time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And so of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point to what distance it is.
By making a laser light, we can record a raw image, which, as you see on the screen, doesn't really make sense, but then we can take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the various light-through-through-exformance, then we can see the object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit more work to do before we can put that into practice, we could build cars that are remote, that can avoid collisions, and recognize what's behind the curve, or we can search for dangerous drones, by looking at light, by looking at light, or we can build endcone, that we can see endcopes in the body around Ok Crus, and also look around the river of Gafo.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, that's a very challenging thing, which is, really, a call for scientists, is to think about Femto photography, because a new imaging process might actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as in Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, science has become a multicillion, an art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we collect every time, we use not just the scientific image. We can also create a new form of computer photography, and we can look at the wave between each time. We can look at the wave of data.
But it's also a fun thing to happen here.
If you look at these waves under the tube, you see the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost recording in the speed of light, weird effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The sequence in the world of events appear in the camera in reverse order, so by applying the actual relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So, whether it's for photography to focus around corners or to create a new model for medicine or new exhibitions since our invention, we've been able to have access to all the data and details on our website, and hope that the "posters and the creative community will show us that we should stop to fix the xenels of the cameras -- to start to innovate on the next dimension.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we humans can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many conversations don't get passed down, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors, and use things like stickers and ribs and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rentes my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscape better?
And how can we share our hopes for never-to-face houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being reassured by the vast oak that has been served for hundreds of years, blessing, drunks and drerows, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time anyone never gets there, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most abandoned parts in America.
I live in the near of this house, and I have thought about how I can get it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it brought me a sense of the things that are important to me now in life.
But it's hard for me to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose and forget to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I transformed a page of the abandoned house into a huge blackboard, and I wrote with a tremore on the blank side: "If I die, I want to die, I want to be a little bit of chalk, can take a piece of life and share its hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled up, and she kept growing.
I want to share some sentences with you, which were written by the people on the wall.
"Before I shall die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"In the first time I die, I want to be more complete about the International Recession line."
"Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."
"In my life, I want to live in eco-friendly."
"Before I die, I want to hold it to my arms once."
"Before I die, I want to be a piece of music."
"In my life, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to the laugh, to the wine, and to satisfy me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, in a new way, in a different way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, and so my colleagues and I built a construction kit, and now in countries like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power our public spaces have when we have the opportunity to rise our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and delicate.
We're often stopped talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation for death is one of the things that strengthens us most.
The thought about death reveals us life.
Our common spaces are the best things we can do as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and our fears and stories, people around us can't just help us to create better places, they can help us to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm looking at the math that I'm doing. I'm a particularly special problem for anyone who's been involved with this on teaching math, is that we're like business consultants.
No one knows what we're doing.
So today, I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing.
Teaching is one of the most human activity.
We are thrilled to see the wrestling ballet and get biking as you'll see.
So, for a ballet, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and maybe a fundamental signal that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly break down these extraordinary ability, and that's what it does to my rented Jan Stripling, which at the time was a ballet deal.
Over the years, you've made a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they need to live with the harm-adter symptoms like weaknesses, tremor, adulthood, and others that cause this disease, and that's why we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately, the only way we can know is, is there a cure if we have an objective metric that can answer this question?
In trouble, for Parkinson's disease and other disorders of movement, there's no biomarker, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that's there for this 20-minute test at neurologist.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means, outside clinical trials, it's never done.
But what if patients could do this in their homes?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this experiment themselves?
It wouldn't have to be a corporate hospital.
It costs 300 percent to actually explore in the neurological department.
So I want to suggest that we're going to take a very unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a sense, virtual reality like my Iranian and barging.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal sound-wones.
This is what happens in the healthy state, when someone is creating speech sounds. We can look at them as a mood ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs if we make sounds, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
And how ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to have to talk until it's learning.
By the way that sound sounds, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and so the limbs are also affected by the muscles that you're looking at with Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom record, you can see an example of irregular vocal soundshots.
We see the same symptoms.
Regoror, weakness, stiffness.
The language is even becoming more wiser and wiser, and that's an example of the character.
And these impacts on the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision processing software combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now tell where someone is in a spab between disease and health, just because of the vocal sounds.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test is in neurologists.
Not so much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are accurate. They're not exactly the rules that are being done for this.
So they can be done by themselves.
They're very fast, they're at the maximum rate of 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it at large scales.
So these amazing goals we can do with this.
We can reduce logistic difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to perform routine control checks in the hospital.
We can get objective data through a broad lens.
We can do inexpensive mass recruitment for clinical trials, and we can first get the study of the whole population.
We have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the first time before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's health institute.
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we'd like to take a very large number of voices around the world to have enough seed data for their success.
We have calls numbers that are accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on the planet.
Anyone with autism or with no Parkinson's, can't dial a cheap one to leave a few cents. I'm very familiar with joy that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from them, say 10,000 people, you can tell who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient in the caller's phone has to tell if this person has Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be going to be there until the end.
But we collect a huge database, in various circumstances, which is interesting. These circumstances are important because we are wired to look at them to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's.
Right now, your 86 percent accuracy is true?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I need to praise him because he did such amazing work -- has shown now that it also works on the cellular network, which allows this project to be done, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
That is, people can -- people can call with the phone and do the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, have their voice to check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the back, you see my father's cows, and the mine behind is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in the south, in part, in part, that means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, they follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night. I woke up in the morning and I found them dead. It was awful. It was our only Buitt.
My tribe, the colony of the Masai, believes that we were with our animals and our open landways from the sky, and that's why our animals matter to us so much.
As a child, I've learned to hate lions.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our enemies. They are also brought to this problem because of this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park is just as few lions.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years old for his father's cows. That's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but to help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried it with a bird's drawing.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You'll see the bird's records come back and they go again, but the next time, they come and they say, well, the thing doesn't move, that's still there.
And they reach and kill our livestock.
One night, I woke up the cover. I walked around with a slack in the hand around him, and that time the lions didn't get.
Beer fearful of light, moving.
I had an idea.
As a little boy, I was working all day in my room, and I even took my mom's new radio, and I got my mom's new radio, and I got it almost around the day. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a motor drive from a motorcycle. It suggests if you want to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little leaf from a broken pocket lamp.
And then I built it all together.
The solar panel integrates the battery, the battery provides electricity to the right-player. I call it a transformer.
And the driver of the motor is blinking.
You can see the sins are pointing outwards, because they come from the lions.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights blink, and the lions believe I'm walking around the rubble, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our homes, and since then, we have no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights on. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've fed seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really working well.
My idea is now used all over Kenya, including for other predators like hymen or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to go to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved and helping fundraising and education through contributions.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in together, where there's no other lights, and I'm showing people how to use them.
One year ago, I was just a boy from the savanna who was cooking his father's cows. I saw planes over me, and I said, "I'm going to sit in one day."
And here I am.
I was invited to do a plane ride for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a pilot engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to hunt lions, but through my invention, I can save my father's cows and the lions in common with us, we can live side by side with the lions without prejudice.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
They work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. An electroconce?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, don't you? Yes, I've tried it before, but I've given a go back to the test because I got a hit.
Early on, Richard Turer, you're a bit special.
We're going to hire you on any step of your journey, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite paintings, and not one of them I did.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no chance to shoot one image. Not even the lighting was being taken in.
To be honest, most of them were shot from random tourists.
My story starts when I was a speech in New York, and my wife made this picture, where I hold my daughter on my first birthday on my arm, and we were on the corner of 57thows and fiveth birthday.
So one year later, we went back to New York, and we decided to take the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this is going --
When my daughter's third birthday came up, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do it to a father-daughter meeting to continue the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking tourists to take a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a whole stranger to take your camera.
No one ever said no, and fortunately nobody has ever been to bathe with our camera.
Back then, we didn't know how much these travels would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened that day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a given moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to take a year in October, to keep time and change our time, and how we're from year to year, not just physically, but in everything.
Because although we're always making the same picture, our perspective of time is going to change, as they're reaching new milestone, I can see life with their eyes as they're dealing with everything and how they see.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value and expect for every year.
Last days, during one of our trips, we walked for a while, and suddenly they stopped being executed, it shows up on a red brand on a dollboard that they had learned as a little kid in the previous travel.
And she told me about their feelings that she had been given for the right time as five years of life.
She said that she remembers her heart of her chest when she saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks up in New York because she's really interested in studying in New York.
And I realized that it was amazing. The most important thing that we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a more active role in conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not on a family photo.
I'm always the one who makes the picture.
I want to encourage any of you today to come into the picture and tell someone, "Would you like to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 28.06, 58.5/35.5/23.0/15.2 (BP=0.961, ration=0.962)
