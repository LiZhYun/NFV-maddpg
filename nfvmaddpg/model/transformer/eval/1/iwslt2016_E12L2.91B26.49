When I was 11 years old, I was fired by the sounds of a day.
My father heard about his little, gray radio show on the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual at the time, because the news was mostly depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so I was committing for five years as a boy and I was advising my older sister who couldn't have been able to go alone to a secret school.
And so we could both go to school.
Every day, we took another way so that no one could guess where we went.
We're hidden in our books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just going to buy a shopping.
We've been doing a house where we've been on 100 girls in a small living room.
It was kind of a nasty thing in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in summer.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then again, the class had to be accidental for a week, because the Taliban had signed up.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Did they challenge us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky enough to grow up in a family where education was critical and valued and my daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign man from a remote province in Afghanistan, and he insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- to get to school, and was rejected by his father.
But my trained mother became a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement, just to turn our house to school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- look here -- was the first person in his family who ever received an education.
And it was always obvious that his kids would receive education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He saw it as a much greater risk to send his kids not to school.
I know that in the years, I was frustrated, sometimes, in the Taliban, by our lives, by the perpetual fear and the perspective of ignorance.
I had good joke to give up, but my father said, "Daughter, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be displaced in war.
But one thing will always remain you: what's inside of it, and even if we have to pay for your blood to your school sales, we'll do that.
So -- do you want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have a higher degree than a high school degree, and if my family hadn't been so much used for my education, I would be one of those women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudly single-docin at the Midbury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was distracted by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first ones that valid me.
He's not just a professor of college, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the one who runs him through the car through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more potential dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to build SOLA, and perhaps the first department for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls's school workers are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how students at school want to sense all of them's potential opportunities.
And see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, and my parents, even though they were, despite all due to their abducted adversaries.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of a student.
A month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and she's the death of a bomb on the side of the road just took a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rings, and a voice beat him, if he sent his daughter to school, they would try it again.
He said, "You know, now, if you want to, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the table because of your old-great-pived and over-expived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often accepted in the West: behind most of us who succeeds, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that is that her success is also her success.
That's not to say that our mothers don't matter what we're doing in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones who are starting to express themselves credible and persuasively accessible to the future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely essential.
And under the Taliban, there were only a few hundred girls who went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, so different.
Americans recognize how uncertainty these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long-term, and the distribution of the U.S. troops is changing everything.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see the students in my school, and her parents who are using it for them, I see a promising future and a long-lasting change.
Afghanistan, for me, is a country of hope and the unregulated possibilities, and I remember the girls who visit SOLA every day.
Just like me, they have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, including profession -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977, I look young, but I don't -- I've -- I've got to Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, projects on the engineering collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I think 21 years, we were a brilliant good person, and we made good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples for Zambezi," was one of the things we wanted to show in Italy to the people of Sambia to be the production of food.
We came to Italian seeds in South Africa, and we got this one-way valley, which leads to Sambesi River, and we trained the local population of the farming of Italian tomato and Tocini and ...
Of course, the local had absolutely no interest in this, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they began to appear.
We were amazed that there was no such fertile valley in such a crop of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Sear time to save people from the catadores."
Of course, everything wonderfully rational about Africa.
We had this gorgeous tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how simple agriculture is."
When the tomato gas rose and red was red, over the night, there were about 200 pine roders from the river and swirling everything.
We said to the Guamb tsunami, "Oh God, the Fil Army!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were Italian-doughy in Africa, but I saw what the Americans did, what the French did, and after I saw what they did, I was pretty proudly proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the nastroads.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense we didn't have the existing African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a paradist of economics.
The book was published in 2009.
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been done.
Just read her book.
Reading from a African man, which we've been doing.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionals, and there are only two ways that we deal with people, and we paratulate them, or we're patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vater,"
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchical: I treat every other culture, as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I treat every other culture, as if they were my servant.
So white people in Africa are called "bhenure," the boss,
I was stoked when I read the book "Sall Beauty" by laughter. He said, most of all the things about economics, if people don't want help, they leave them alone.
This is the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, ran a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocololial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and I created a system called business promotion, which never is being launched, never gets someone motivated, but you're going to be the CEO of local passion, the servant of local people who have the dream to be better.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put them together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in a pitchet.
We don't have a infrastructure.
We close friendhood, and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for your growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing to humanity.
We're helping them to find the knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
I had this case many years ago, and I had this case: Why, instead of getting into a community and saying, "Why don't we hear them, why don't we hear them? But not in community collectors.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
entrepreneurs never have in part, and they will never say public what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Design has this light-up.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to public meetings.
We're working to one to do this, we've got to be made a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It has to be created by a new job.
This is the company's hospital, the hospital of the company who sits with you in the house with your kitchen table and in the cafe, helping you find the means to transform your passion in a way to change life.
I've tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was a little bit reluctant to go out at the time, and I was trying to get out the crushing, and I was trying to get out of the other things that we should do.
And so I walked through the streets for the first year, and I had my first three days of customers, and I helped him. He was in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell him to a restaurant in Perth, and he came to the fishermen, and they said, "You've helped the Maori help us?"
I helped these five fishers, and I didn't have this wonderful tuna in Albany to 60 cents, but to Japan for sushi for 15 dollars.Kilo. Then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you could help them. Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects in one year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do? I said, "I do something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Tell it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 50,000 companies at the start of the organization.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on on on loneliness.
Peter Cash, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter Cash was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter Cash said, "Dield is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty force.
So you build Christchurch, and you can't know what the smartest person Christchurch's wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to one.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they will come in.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and passion?
What's the most cheierdy thing you've done tomorrow?
"Sone, passionate people. You hated this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We're at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- the calculated fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that aren't sustainable.
The internal engine is not sustainable.
The open-art realm of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, re-engineer, transport them and sub-connected them.
The technologies don't exist for this.
Who's going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it.
It will be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860s.
In 1860, they came together and they created, and what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was, "The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows on this pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get them to the point, and it would be impossible to get the crap of six million horses.
Because they were already lying in crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that makes life warm up from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive maker in the U.S. -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology was to have the race. There were little factories in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered discretionionion.
Otherwise, they don't come and they're talking to you.
The next thing you have to offer them absolute, dedicated and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of you have to be able to do three things: to sell that product, which is great, the market market needs to be great, and the financial intelligence must be massive.
Do you guess what?
We never met one person who can produce a difference at the same time and sell for money.
That doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We did research and we looked at the 100 issest companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been mean, only one thing that's founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 years of working in Northhouse entrepreneurs, and we start giving them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Autographs, and the job of the 16-year-old student is to support Richard Brans's first two sides of Medicine's autobiography, and how often he uses the word "I'm talking about," and how many times the word "we"
Never "I" and 32 times "we"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator, who has a small developer, sit in cafes and bars. Their dedicated buddy, who will do what someone for this gentleman who talks about this eposman. Somebody's going to say, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting corporations to help them find the resources and the people, and we've found that the wonders of the intelligence of local population can be changed, that the culture and the economy of that community can only capture the passion, the energy and the imagination of the people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be Alice's miracles.
The Penn State University asked me -- a charity for communications -- to try to connect courses in communication.
I was scared.
I'm afraid. Fear of these students with their large brains and their big books and their big, I don't trust words.
But when the conversation came to me, he used to take me like Alice, when she took down to the pig's pig and saw a door to a completely new world.
I felt like I was talking to students, and I was amazed by the idea they had, and I wanted others to discover this miracle country.
I think that I'm going to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy and environment, and if we don't know about it, and it doesn't work. I think it's in our responsibility as non-profits, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miraclesland.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
I want to show you a couple of approaches to how you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're looking at is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well, what?
Let's tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only do you think of your grandchildren, but also tells us that their phrases, the material structure in our bones, are examined because it's important to understand osteoposis and treat.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to have any language.
In the words, there's a barrier to understanding your mind.
I don't know if you could use "discovery" and "time" but why don't you just say "space and time" and time," what's much more enjoyable to us?
And to make your mind understandable, not the same as to dacing your level.
As Einstein said, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can certainly tell us something about your scientific field without having to deal with tradeoffs.
So a few things about this is that, for example, examples, of stories and analogies, you can pull us into your worm, and that's how you can pull us into your worm.
And if you're presented to your work, then let the dots go away.
Have you ever asked why it's called "Stide point?"
What happens when someone gets to mind? Another one is getting stabbed, and with those dots, your audience first one.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits too much on the conversation-making part of our brain, and so we're quickly challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the waist is so robust that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel worm.
The trick here is to use a single, simple word, where the audience can lose the thread, act on the screen, and measure images and graphics that also makes our other senses more meaningful and more sense of what it describes.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up the door and see the miracleland that celebrates science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the "Nerdin In" button, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
If you look at your science and your linguistic words, it's shared by the relevance, so the audience is important, and multiply the whole thing that you have for your incredible work: and it comes from that, you get the unimaginable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really embarrassed by that.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can tweet a message with a cell phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can record a song, you can get high-petched on sound cloud and famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1904, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see hundreds of thousands of people going on the street and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're wondering that all of these people who were coming into and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phone up, hold it up!
Hold it up. An Android, an Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, my cell phone wants to talk about me and my cell phone and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines of information.
Plust data.
And why are this information there?
Because in summer 2006, E.A. Senate has set up a rule.
This is a rule of law enforcement management.
This rule of law is that every business company in Europe, every Internet serviceman in Europe, has to store a range of users' information.
Who calls? Who's sending an email?
Who is sending text messages to whom?
And if you use a cell phone, where you're.
All this information is saved for at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet carriers.
And everywhere in Europe, people are all up, and they said, "We don't want that."
They said, we don't want to have this administrative protection.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of whom said, "We don't want that."
And here you can see tens of thousands of people pouring out on the streets of Berlin, saying, "Songness rather than fear."
And some people even said that this could be a be a beya 2.0.
The fire was the Teimpol policei in eastern Germany.
And I'm also wondering if this really works.
Can this really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Declagina business, which was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, let me send all the information you've been saving over me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again and I didn't get a right answer. Only Ma Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life, that you've been doing the protocol.
So I decided to set up a court trial against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
And at the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to take the account back to what they all demanded information to me.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of the E.U. was a German legal response.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 points of information.
I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My hand.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do to do with this?
Because you see where I'm, where I'm asleep, what I do at night.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what's called the law enforcement.
So with time online and open data City, I did this.
This is an visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and forth.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see that I'm driving from Frankfurt with the train to Kumble<unk>n, and how many calls I'm going to walk along.
And this is all possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then a few friends call me up, and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up, and you call you, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see people communicating with each other, and they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central figures, like who is the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a design plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who to whom to send an email, all of this is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is saved for at least six months, in Europe, to two years.
As I said, at the beginning, we imagine that all of these people in the streets of Berlins, in 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the fire would have known who was at stake, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders were, that might never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe it wouldn't have happened.
And then, not the case of the Ice curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so much information, as they can get over us, online and rival.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store all of that well-range.
But self-determin and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your opponents, just because companies and government places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information that they've stored on.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: chain stores, rapid restaurants, brk.
So the city map is meeting, and they're thinking about changing the name of South Central, so that it's a different thing, it's changing in South Los Angeles, like this is changing what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Ordinary stores, rapid restaurants, bride.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the Drivebys.
The great thing is that the Drive-thrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in perfect diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it's at Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't catch that up anymore.
And I wondered how you felt, if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you walk out of the house, the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I'm thinking that carriers bought and sold as a vehicle.
I see the dialogue centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
I didn't have any fun at 45 minutes's funeral to get an apple that's not adept to the pesticide.
So I planted a food rocket in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call parkwater.
It's 45 feet in three feet.
The thing is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility and I need to be in charge."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, and we started to plant my food heat and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of executive group, together from gardening from all the social layers and from all the city, and it's completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came to me, and he basically assigned me a plane, and said I have to remove my garden, the station became a seduction force.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A seductive set of calls for growing food fires on a piece of land that you're completely alive?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herds with this."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from this. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and talked to the city Council and a member of Green Ground Zero, and they made a petition on the front lines.org and 900 signatures we succeeded.
We held the victory in the hands.
My town bank even called, and said that they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most of the real estate in the United States.
They have 67-mile-foot-cap-pall-hat-hat-metching.
This is 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato gas plants.
Why the hell would they not find it okay?
Through growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my body of healing, I'm telling people that they should grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up. I raised my sons there.
And I feel like I'm part of this preconceived reality made by other people, and I made my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
So gardening is my graffiti. I'm picking up my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm going to fill lawns and park facilities.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my marks for this stuff.
You would be surprised to see what the ground can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as a tool for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the floor.
You would wonder how kids will be influenced by this.
So gardening is the most therapeutic and most bold act that you can do, especially in the city.
You get strawberry straw.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 a night. They were in my garden, and I came out and watched them look like this.
I felt really bad, because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not for any reason on the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just got me to do this. People asked me, "Fin, you don't fear people being fired."
And I said, "Sum devil, no, I don't have a fear they're going to kick.
And that's the way it's on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
And one other time, I put a garden in this homeless garden in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even though it's just for a moment.
Green Grounds have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people in our zoning departments, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, kids eat charcoal.
When they grow tomato, they eat tomato.
But if they don't get any of them, if they didn't get shown how food and body affects, they're blind to the same thing that you're going to do.
I see young people who want to work, but they stick in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that they're looking for, and they're not going to get anywhere.
I think that the gardener is an opportunity to train these kids to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire block of gardens, where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a ship card container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-noo, because free is not sustainable.
The great thing about sustainability is that you have to keep it through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and making them the joy and honor to know when you build their own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to be that we're all becoming all environmental rebel, gangsters, gang gardeners.
We need to turn the image of the sq.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You know, you're going to get a dog with a ride, right?
And let the weapon be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're sitting in a box and you want to make a meeting where you're talking about making some shit.
If you want to meet me, come with your knees, in my garden so that we can plant any wrinkles.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford dictionary is "snollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "isless politicians."
Even though a newspaper publisher was awarding a better definition: "A snollygoster is someone who's waiting for a foreign, independent of party, program or performance, and success of its direct power by the pure force of the aristocracy."
I have no idea what the task is.
Something about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
For example, 1771, according to the British Parliament, newspapers didn't have the exact same word of debutney's.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was looking at the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and he sued him, but he was courageous enough, he was brave enough to pursue, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the sentence "so" as Brass." Many people think.
Brassing is a word for the English word for the pist.
But that's not true. It's all about a facilitator of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time when it's just done independence.
You saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a legal nation?
And it was published in Congress for infinite and long.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Govern Washington, and others, his high-violent George Washington, and again, the propensity of the people in the United States of America's America.
Not that special.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that was preventable.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored, because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the book of a editor who constantly wrote, "I've got the same issue."
The reason for the ticking and the boredom was that the relative house was against the Senate.
The representment house didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want it to be.
King calls, and maybe he could bring him into ideas.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most miserable, horrifying title that they thought of.
This title was "Pictor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He had existed before, but he just meant that somebody was running a meeting.
It's kind of like the pre-secution of a jury.
He had no longer the size of the book, or "Dssy" or "paper."
Sometimes, President had small colonial and government groups, but it was really a mispressed title.
And so the Senate refused to get it out.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy has to sign up and hit foreign carriers.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of America's United States?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't come to the bank.
Instead, you didn't want to be the name of the State, but they really wanted to suggest that they didn't want to be helpful for their honest respect and the knowledge and the effective nations, whether it's in the Republic of monarchy, where it's the director of the state that's respected, not necessarily -- the president's chief of the United States, the other people who are concerned with the women's incarceration of the foreignity of the United
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One, and I think that's best -- I don't know if I've ever suggested the president's name, but I've never really shown the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just hated the title. He just waiting for the Senate to be active.
The second thing you can learn is that if a government says that something is temporary -- you wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, and that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is not as humorous, right?
This has to do with something like 5,000 nuclear weapons, which he has and the greatest economy in the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
And reality and story have given the title size.
And so the Senate ended up.
They got a respect title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the outskance of authenticity -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear bombers and so on.
So at the end of the day, the Senate and the representative house won, because no one feels humble, if you're told that you're the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rebellion at the fight for Moalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to wipe my black Concessor's foot against a pair of brown leatherwines and a rocket towards the government hospital that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I'd been big before the war, but I've had been on the news with Pyjama party and football games and tires and shufvies with racist countries and heroistic demonstrations that never had to play with communism and live and devotion and devotion and reframing and scramages before I knew what that was.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, a inspired Afghane, Southeast of God Gnades. An atheist and a radical political artist who's been working for the last nine years in Afghanistan, and has created.
So, there are a lot of great things in Afghanistan about how to make art, but I personally don't like rainwords. I want to make art that motivates the personality and challenges and re-pending the narrative and re-scange reality and actually using a kind of a kind of imaginative human-made citizen to try to figure out the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in life of a jihad -- a jihad that's going to be responsible for its communist, like "Pop Staring," and uses armed anxiety and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can jihad do when it's a lawyer and a campaign that's called, "You know, I'm making jihad, and I'm rich."
And I'm trying to use this campaign to leave this mafiosi that's a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "reemcess," where you get a cop, a false control center of Kabul and run cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money to the police department in Kabul, and giving them permission to the police department for the police. And they hope that they accept 100 million of them.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become, I think, the Intermodest conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him, they created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture using a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I'm designing the Frutan-Brenching clothes with a protective-pipped-pilled or a multi-pelled-pipped-pipped-pipped-in-in-the-mesting-mesting-all.
And I would like to see what a simple taper from Kabul looks like by Kiplell's app with 1899 to create a dialogue about the current development organization of development leaders in the past-elected graffiti rhetoric of the White Shords to protect the brown man from himself and even a few veterans.
But for all of these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood, misrepresented.
But I do, because I have to, because the geography of self needs it.
This is my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for some time, I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, exactly what I've been saying.
I feel like now that there's a very uncomfortable tension in the room, because I didn't have to wear that dress.
Fortunately, I have something to do with change.
This is the first time someone's walking around the TED stage, so you can appreciate seeing this, I think.
If a few women were really excited when I came out, you don't need me to tell me that later I read on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think of me.
And no one has the chance to do that.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're going to all be embarrassed by me, so you don't do anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, I think it was not as embarrassing as this image.
A visual is powerful, but a image is also superficial.
I just changed your opinion in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to throw my back and put my hand into the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the false brine that I took for two days ago, there are very few ways to change our utterances, and our utterance -- although it's super-expable and irreversible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless, for me, is to be honest today.
And I stand on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a really nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe you wonder what this legacy is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, where we are biologically programmed, but as big, pounding, feminine and bright-bravers.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion agents might be like, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smrow. Liee.
And first of all, I'm commenting your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious doctor in 2007 had counted all the modules on the sidewalks, each single one that was being dated, and that from 677-tinted mode, only 27 or less than four percent of the time.
The next question I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And I first say, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-law, which would be completely wrong, because then you'd be the first one."
If they still say after this great requirement, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who my boss."
Because I don't have responsibility for anything, and you could be the president of American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that later, you want to become a model, like, you're going to say that you want to win the Jack Prize in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to show you 10 years of engineered model, because it can only be possible as a heart surgeon.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a photo to run," well, the leg first thing that's going to be nice, and long, that arm goes back, this arm, this arm is on the front, and you're moving back to three-quarters of the foot, and you can just see that way back to the side of the side of the day
It looks something like this.
I hope that it's less weird than it does in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and have done a few jobs, and you can't tell a lot more, because if you want to be President of the United States, but in the way, "10 years of underwear," you'll be looking at weird.
The next question I've been asked is, "Who is going to take all the photos?"
And yes, almost all the photos are stored, but that's just a little part of what happened.
This is the first photo I made, and this was the first time I carried a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this film.
My friend had to be ashamed.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days ago for the French birdgy.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not images of me.
It's constructed, and it's a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and Machup-A-D-and-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th
Okay, so next thing, people always ask me, "Well, did you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-meter-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-e-shirts that I can't wear, but the things that I get free are things that I'm not going to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a horrible driver, and she was walking over a red light, and of course we were stopped. It was just a thing: "Excuse me, Mr. Words," and we could go on.
I got these kind of free things because of my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who are not paying a lot of money for their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York and from 140,000 teenagers who have been shot and filtered last year, 85 percent of black and Latino and most young men.
It's only 177,000 young, male and Latino, who doesn't say, "Am I going to have a talk?"
But, "How often am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
And I found out that in my research, 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is 78 percent, if they got 17 years old.
The last question I've been asking is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they expect this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and gluteny hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backstage, we'll give a answer that might be given to this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring people."
All of this is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, which I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsafe."
And I feel unsafe because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I happy if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest blade of bookes, and they're the ones that are probably the ones that are most vulnerable women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to get a more honest balance, because one of the things I felt really uncomfortable about getting me here and saying, "I got all the benefits of a stack that was being pulled out of my favor," and it doesn't feel very good at me, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was very difficult to unite a legacy of oppression for gender and race, if I'm one of the biggest supplementers of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done this before 10 or 20 years or 30 years, and my career has been plidiful, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I was paid college, which is so important.
If you take something out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misguided success and failure.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother, who came to life in exil, "Son, Gaddafi Resist. Shieze him.
But never be to something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's now almost two years since the British Revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass mass operations, both in the Tunisian revolution.
I joined with many other Libyers, in and out of the outside of Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, nomadic women and men stood in the first row, and the end of the regime, the Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They have demonstrated plausible mutant by placing on the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east, across the far west, to the south.
Finally, after six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 deaths, we were able to liberate our country and to reduce the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a great servant, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the process.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannic regime has both destroyed infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I knew how many other women, I rented to rebuild the civil society of Lybia, and we asked them to have a judged and unchanging transition to democracy and national failure.
Nare to 200 organizations were founded while and immediately after Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exil, I came back to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to the issues of accomplishment, human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Libyians, a movement of women, leaders of various life-making, whose goal is to be public for the sociological empowerment of women and to our right to vote for the right of the justice of democracy and peacebuilding.
In the elections, I met in a very difficult environment, a environment that was polarized, a common environment that was shaped by the selfish political politics of dominance and execution.
I led an initiative to the Peace Prize of Marine Women to get a policy law, a law that any citizen, no matter what the right to vote, to vote for and to fight, and to face, and to address, above all, to a political parties, a relationship between male and female and female officials to narrow up vertical-scale and horizontal level and to make a constant donation.
At the end, our initiative was taken over and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the national jurisdiction in the first elections since 52 years.
But it was very, very seriously, the euphorism of elections and the entire revolution, because every day we started to get new messages from violence.
We went to the ceremony about the Sapties of ancient mosques and Sufi leaders.
On another morning, we received news about the murder of American ambassador and attack on the message.
And then again, another morning, the murder of the armed forces were signed by the army.
And really every day, we've been looking at the tyranny of the milititers and their ongoing success on human rights and their neglect of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind, polarized, and distant from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- which they had initially accepted.
Intuse, disbelief and revenge became the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our pressing audience and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to confess that as a nation, we've made false choices and false decisions.
We put our priorities wrong.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability or safety in Lybia.
Did the hard-heard and the change between female and male leaders have led peace and national acumen?
No, it didn't.
What is it then?
Why will our society still polarized and dominate the dominance of dominance and purpose, both of men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones that missed it, but the female values of empathy, the Gnade and the one who was.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a consensus to it as it needed to have elections, which ultimately has strengthening the polarization and decoration.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop acting in the name of anger and ask a day of revenge.
We need to start acting in the name of empathy and the giade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't only value the next values, but it also raises the problem: that, instead of revenge, cooperation, instead of a competition, rather than execution.
These are the ideals that need one of the dusted lybia to get peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in this alchemy, it's about the relis of feminine and masky view.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do this in general before we do it socio-Indically.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam," peace -- "is the word of the good God, rawled."
The word "raheem" again, which is known in all of the abrally-an-an-states, has the same Arabic root as the word "rairhem" and symbolized the matal feminine, which surrounds the whole humanity, the man-them and the female, of all the tribes and all the tribes.
And just like the mother's matri, which grows in him, it's so much of the basic comfort of compassion that's all of its existence.
And so I said, "My Gnade is all about it."
And so I said, "My Gnade has been pre-dipped before I was Groll."
I want to be saved by all of us to the giah.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing" in the book.
And I was very proud.
In school, we ran the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I often wondered what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a change-changing time.
When I was seven years old, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter to a friend named a colleague of mine.
And he said, "If you know this, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore, because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
I was about to go through the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A hacked woman was lying on the ground, and a car in her arm was sliced in the face of his mother.
But no one helped them because everybody was so busy to care for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
And at the end of the day, more than a million North Koreans were dying of famine, and many more people survived because they ate grass, and the beetles and the tree canopy.
So electricity loss has become increasingly, so that at night, everything around me has been blurting away, except for the lights of China on the other side of the fish that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors on night.
This is the river of the amp, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vigorously, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can tell that while I was sent to the warranty years to the remote relatives of China.
I just thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take 14 years to revive again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have an idea of what life would be like as a North Korean refugee, but soon I learned that it's not only very difficult, but it's very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in silence, fear that my true identity could fly, and you would be sent back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare dream was true when I was caught by the Chinese police and sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be Northan woman, so they tested my Chinese records and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought, "I'd have a heart explode.
If there's anything unnatural, I could be imprisoned and arrested.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the poll, a official said to the other person, "That was a false failure.
She's not a North Korean."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are scrambling in foreign messages, likeyl, but many of them are caught by Chinese police and rejected.
These girls had great fortune.
Even though they got caught, they eventually released out of massive international printing.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are released to North Korea, where they are tortured, imprisoned, or imprisoned,
Although I was lucky enough to be born, many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard to survive.
After learning a new language and found work, their world can be put on a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I was in South Korea, a bigger challenge, when I thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
I also experienced the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of us, we've been very diverged by 67 years of division.
I was through a identity crisis.
Am I South or Northan-an-law?
Where am I? Who am I?
And suddenly, no country that could have been my home.
Even though the adaptation to the Southern Korean life didn't get easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show at university.
Just as I became a new life-friendly, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities started the money I sent my family, and as punishment, my family was moved to a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to take an incredible route to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself go to the northwest border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run them, over 2,000 miles through China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we've almost caught several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese officer promised my family, I agreed, and told him she was a her-fopping, and I was her commaint.
He looked at me in a wizic, but luckily, he believed me.
We've managed to get it to the moderate border, but I had to use almost all my money to get the border control of Laos.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and bribe, my family got released in a month, but shortly after that, my family was re-fipped, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest disengage of my life.
I had done everything to protect my family, and we were so close to it, but my family has been arrested just before the Southern Korean Embassy.
I went and I went from the Ministry of Marine Agency and the police department, and I desperately tried to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back-of-the-life money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And I was wondering, "What's the voice of a man?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is taking care of it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without being a police officer, he went to a bank machine, and he paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get it out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger, I think, symbolized a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of international community as the hope to keep the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were united in South Korea, but the freedom of freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, the workforce and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family workers, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to have a hopeful North Koreans to succeed, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, but on stage of TED.
Thank you.
I have one request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big, very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it unconditional, and he shares it unconditional.
He's not stupid. He doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to think of words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has an absolutely unbiased memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate bracks, but he remembers the publication of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while the first episode of the teoonbies on my arm and had G Lady Buragas's birthday.
Don't you listen to incredible things?
But a lot of people don't vote.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and wrong.
But what motivates my heart and my soul was empowered was that, although that was the case, although they didn't usually be seen, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that affect social communications, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a different thing to be different in every individual, so that's what Remi is different from.
And in the world, every 20 minutes in a new person, autism is discovered, and although it's one of the fastest growing interventions in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been through autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very much.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and reorganized in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, putting the washing machine and eating everything that came under it.
And when he got older, he became different, and the differences became visible.
But behind the anger and the raz and the hidden hyperactivity, something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been struck.
It's extraordinary.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normality covers the beauty that differences give us, and the fact that we're different is not because one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift. Each of us has a gift in it, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying at the moment that we try to do what someone else is.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been filled with awe and curiosity, and this photo on this project has a apple and a cat with a mass of trash time, only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion pictures per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto-D photography, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can make slow-time-lapse images of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look beyond our perspective and look around corners or without an <unk>-ray image in our body and really ask what we mean with my camera.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I take it into a billionth of a second -- these are several t-seconds -- I'm going to create a package of photons that's barely a millimeter-sized, and this photon-patch, this project, this project, is going to move on faster and speed, and it's like, a million times faster than a second project.
So if you take this project, this photon pack and you take it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So, think about this event, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotore -- so long as the light takes to get back to this lane -- but I'm trying to add this video to 10 billion so that you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, comes into the bottle with a photon pack, which starts to move through, and ultimately breaks inside.
Part of the light is flowing outwards to the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
Many of the photons eventually achieve the delusion of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that's going on in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out of the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a normal project and let it go back the same route and slow the video back 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about something but a still-time photographer?
You can see again how these waves of the table, the Tomate and the wall upside down.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed to me that nature is painting this picture, each of the one-way image, but of course our eye looks a composted image.
But if you look at this Tomate again, you'll realize that if the light is rolling over the Tomate, it's going to keep going. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomate is coming up and the light jumps around you and comes back after a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your camera's cameray, it might be possible that you could go to a supermarket and see if a fruit is a fruit, without touching it.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with a short time of mass, you have very little light, but we're going to have a billion times faster than your very short duration of war, so you're getting no light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon pack, a million times, and we're drawing it back with very clever synchronization, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superheroes: can we see corners?
The idea is that we're turning light on the door.
It will be clogged, go into space, and part of it will be reflected back to the door, and eventually we could use that multi-stranded light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden in a puppet, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the International Communications Journal, it was taken out of Nature.com, and they made this animation.
We're going to take this light project and we're going to squeeze it back to this wall, and this photon pack is going to be dragged into all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will be able to break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light and a tiny number of photons will come back to the camera, but it's going to be very close to the top time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique ability.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And so of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point is to what distance.
So by making a laser light, we can record a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- not really makes sense, but then when we take a lot of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the various light-through memory processes, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit more to do before we can put this into the lab in practice, we could build cars that can avoid collisions, and see what's on the curve, or we can look for dangerous amounts of survivors, by looking at light through the open windows, or we can build endcoos that see the body deep in the body around the body around Okcho.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, which is really a web call for scientists, now, thinking about Femto photography, because a new model of imaging could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edgerton, a recent scientist, science has become an art, an ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data we've been collecting every time, not just using the scientific processing process. We can also create a new form of computer photography, with paint and color bone bones, and we can't look at the wave of time.
But it's also a fun thing to do here.
If you look at these waves under the pool, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move us.
What's going on here?
And it turns out that we, because we almost have a light speed, we have weird effects, and Einstein would love to see this image incredibly.
The order of events in the world, in the history of events, is going to appear in reverse order, so by measuring the relationship between space and time, we can correct those biases.
So whether it's time for photography to navigate or creating a new model for medicine or new exhibitions, since we've made all of the data and detail on our website, and hope that the heroic managers and the creative and the research community will tell us that we should stop on the megapixs of the camera, the next one to start the next one, to start the next one, to start the next one of the next data, to start the next data, to start
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many of the discussions don't get passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors, and I've been trying to use things like stickers and crises and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, like, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscape better?
And how can we share our hopes for dream-free houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is stunned by the giant oak that has been in the last hundreds of years of loving, drunk and shuffy shadows. I trust a city where there are always music.
I think every time anyone never ever ever ever ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the conditions in America.
I live in the way near this house, and I thought about how I can make it, and I thought about what my life has changed forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in now.
But I'm hard to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose and forget, in the everyday life, what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned House into a giant panel and I wrote a wall of the gaps, "Before I die, I want to die!" Everybody coming to a piece of chalk, can take a piece of life and think about his hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely crowded, and it grew.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I'm dying, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I'd like to die, I want to stand on the International Recession."
"Fear I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'd like to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm dying, I want to live in webless."
"I'd like to die, I want to hold it in my arms."
"I'm dying, I want to be a person's cavicry."
"I'm dying, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh and wine and saves me while the hardest time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's in a new way.
It's about creating space and thinking and thinking, what's most important to us, as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I got hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a construction kit, and now in countries like Kazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces, if we have the opportunity to stand up and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We often miss the fact that we're going to talk about death, or we're going to think about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthen us most.
The idea of death illustrates us the life.
Our common spaces are the best part of what we believe as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and fears and stories, people can't just help us to create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm looking at math. I'm doing a very special problem for anyone who's been engaged in the process of math, is that we're like business workers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing today.
So dancing is one of the most human activities.
We're delighted to see the mastering ballett and teammers, as you'll see.
So, for ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and maybe a fundamental point of performance that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroyed this extraordinary ability, and that's what it does to my slave's Gurival, which at his time was a balletviret's mind.
Over the years, you've done a lot of advances in treatment.
But yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the improbable symptoms like weakness, killers, killings, and others who are more likely to get this disease, and so we need objective resources to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress objective, and ultimately, the only way to know if there is a cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
In trouble, I think that if you have Parkinson's disease and other people's control, you can't do a simple blood analysis, and the best thing you can do is that there's this 20-minute test at neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means, outside clinical trials, it never does. Never.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't need a corporate hospital.
It costs 300 percent, by the way, to look at the neurological state.
So I want to suggest to you an unconventional method that we're trying to do this, because we're all, in a sense, virtual nuteness like my Iranian Strip.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This is what happens in a healthy state, if somebody's writing sounds, we can look at it as a legitimate ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all of these vocal organs if we can make sound, and we all have the genes for it.comP2.
And like ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until they're speaking.
And by clicking, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and as the limbs are also affected by the muscles of Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom record, you can see an example of irregular vocal resonance processing.
We always see the same symptoms.
Regoror, weakness, sininess.
The language will even be a more freny and airlish, and that's an example of it.
And this effect of the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision software, combined with new machine learning, which is now very advanced, we can now tell where someone is in a GPS between disease and health, just because of the vocal muscles.
How can you measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test with neurologists.
And it's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both of them are accurate. They're not going to be done by experts.
So they can be done by themselves.
They're very fast, it's about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a high scale.
So this amazing goals we can do with this.
We can reduce logistics difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through more common observation.
We can do low-cost mass-pancing efforts for clinical trials, and we can first get a research to the entire population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's headquarters.
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we want to take a very large number of voices in the world to have enough seed data, to provide that mission to that goals.
We have reputation numbers that are available to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who, without Parkinson's, can buy cheap to leave a few-cent-m-a-half-hour images. I'm very lucky that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of it, say 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happening is that the patient has to admit in the call, whether this person has Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them might not be able to get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in various circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we're going to be able to sign these to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
Right now, you have 86 percent accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to force him because he's done such fantastic work -- has shown now that it's working on the cell phone network, which allows this project to be 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
So people can -- people can call up the cell phone and do the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, let your doctor check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and the mine behind is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in the South, and that means that wildlife can rely on the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, they follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night, and I woke up in the morning and found it dead. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we came together with our animals and the openland of heaven, and so our animals mean so much.
I learned lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our loved ones. They're also in charge of this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park, there are just so few lions.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years of his father's cows. That's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Bears fear of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but to help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't get on. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried it with a bird's fish.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to be next to the cow's Day.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird's records and go back. But the next time, they come, and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they take a chance and they kill our livestock.
One night, I woke up the bar. I walked around the hand with a tap, and that time the lions didn't get caught.
Beers fearing light, which moves.
I had an idea.
I was working all day in my room, and I was able to take my mom's new radio apart. And the day, she almost took me. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a motor race from a motorcycle, and I can tell if you want to turn right or left. He's blinking.
And I made a switch to turn the lights off.
This is a little cup of a broken shoe lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel has a battery that provides the battery to drive electricity. I call it a transformer.
And the motor engine is bright.
You can see that the pits show outwards, because they come from there,
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights glow, and the lions believe I'm walking around the bar, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our homes, and since then, we have no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've spent seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they really work really well.
My idea is now used in all Kenya, including for other predators like hysenids or leopards, and the lights are also used to keep elephants remotely away from farms.
My invention took me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is committed to fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we put the lights where there's no other, and I'm showing people how to use them.
I was just a boy from the savanna who washed his father's cows. I saw airplanes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one day!"
And here I am.
I was allowed to draw with an airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to name lions, but by my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can connect to the side of the lion, without arguments.
Ash<unk>n. I think that means, in my language, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. A electrode thing?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, not yes, I've tried it before, but I've given the attempt because I got a bullet.
It's hard. Richard Turder, you're a little bit special.
We're going to hire you on any step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and I didn't have one of them.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting was considered to be seen.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random-page tourists.
My story begins when I was a speech in New York, and my wife made this picture where I held my daughter on her first birthday on my arm, and we were on the corner of 57th and five-week.
And so one year later, we went back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this is going --
When my daughter's third birthday came up, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina to New York and do it a father-boy-law to keep the ritual going on?"
And then we started asking the new tourists to come back and try to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to have a whole stranger's camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately nobody is still sitting with our camera.
We didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This one was taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened that day so that a five-year-old could understand it.
These images are much more than just a coincidence moment, or a specific journey.
They're also a way for us to keep time in October a week and how we change from year and year, not just physically, but in everything.
Because while we always make the same image, our perspective of time changes, as it's always reaching new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything and how it sees.
And this very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value and expect every year.
And then, while one of our travels, we walked a walk, and suddenly it remained as a result, it shows up on a red bar on a dollboard that she had learned as a little child, at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings she had thought of as five-year-old at that point.
She said that she remembers her heart of her, when she saw the chair nine years ago, she first saw the store.
And now she looks at high school schools in New York because she really wants to study in New York.
And I realized that, the most important thing we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not at all a family photo.
I'm always the one who makes this picture.
I want to encourage anyone today to come to the image and not ask someone, "Would you like to make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
