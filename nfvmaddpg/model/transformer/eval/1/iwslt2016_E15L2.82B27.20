When I was 11 years old, I was hit by the sounds of a day of a child-friendly joy.
My father heard on his little, gray radio show of the BBC news.
He looked very happy at what was actually quite unusual at the time, because the news was often depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so I was hunted for five years as a boy, and I was advising my older sister who was not allowed to go alone to a secret school.
And so we could go both to school.
Every day, we took another way so nobody could guess where we went.
We hidden our books in a grocery store so it looked like we're just going to buy a grocery store.
We've been put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was kind of nice in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And every single day, the class had to be noticed for a week because the Taliban had been spotted.
We never were sure how much they knew about us.
Did they tell us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school anyway.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued and separated.
My grandfather was ahead of his day.
A foreign stranger from a remote province of Afghanistan. He insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
My mother-teabled, but she became a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to retirement just to turn our house into a school for girls and women.
And my father -- look here -- was the first person in his family who ever got an education.
And for him, he was always realized that his children would be able to get education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He saw it as a much greater risk to not send his children to school.
I know, even right now, that I was so frustrated in the Taliban in the years by our lives, by the constant fear and the interrelation of the relationship.
I had good idea to quit, but my father said, "Teardy, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing will always remain you: what's inside of it. And even if we have to pay for your blood to your school sales, we'll do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women of my age have higher degree than the high school degree, and if my family hadn't been used so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proud single single of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first to congratulate me.
He's not just a graduate student, but also that I was the first woman and I'm the car driving through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
That's why I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I've helped to start SOLA, the first and perhaps the only board of girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls' school workers are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how students at school have great ambition to see all of them with their careers.
And see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as well as my parents were, despite each other's own concerns.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter was his daughter, and he was on the way home from SOLA, and she's the death of the road by a bomb on the side for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang, and a voice beated him if he got his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, "Take me now if you want to, but I won't put my daughter's future on the game because of your old and over-expived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often left in the West: behind most of us who succeed, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that is aware of her success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not going to have a big role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones who are often well-versive and compelling to their daughters' future, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And under the Taliban, there were only a few hundred girls going to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, more than three million girls are pushing the board.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, so different.
Americans recognize how uncertain these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long, and they're changing with the U.S. troops.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, they're encouraging them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan, for me, is a country of hope and unlimited possibility, and it reminds me of the girls who visit SOLA every day.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including a profession -- my life -- was coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977, I'm young to see it, but I'm not -- -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia on the projects of engineering with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I think 21 years, we're Italian, and we've made good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples of the Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people of the world in Italy, the people of Sambias, how to be used to grow food.
We got to the South Africa with Italian seed seeds, in this compressed valley, which leads to Samati River, and we trained in the local population of the local population, the agricultural tomato and the mcini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they began to come.
We were surprised that in such a fertile valley, there were no agricultural facilities.
But instead of asking why they didn't make any, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Searst to save people from the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderfully in Africa is true.
We had this brilliant tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the epraders, "Look, how simple agriculture is."
When the tomato gas came up and red, over the night, there were about 200 nanars coming out of the river and counting everything.
We said to the Guambel, "Oh God, the nudges!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were Italian in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French people did, and after I saw what they did, I realized what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the nudges.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense that we didn't have the same diversity of African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a peer-American economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We have the Dutch World Bank given 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read your book.
You read from an African man who we've done.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways that we deal with people. We parat them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "fater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisung: I treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "b tyrug," they call up.
I was bathed up when I read the book "Ses Beautiful" by laughter. He said, most importantly, in economics, if people don't want help, they let them stay alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, set up a pole, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolatial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just respond to people and invent a system called business promotion, where no one ever is being initiated, but you will never be motivated to provide the local passion director, the local community's servant, the servant of the people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you keep your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put them together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in kitchipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends, and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like what you should do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing about humanity.
We're helping them to find knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why, instead of getting into a community and telling people what they should do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
Entrepreneurs never have a participant, and they will never say public what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Designing has this light spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to public meetings.
We work to do one to one to do that, we need to be able to produce a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the hospital of the company who sits with you in the house, in your kitchen table and in the coffee, helps you find the means of transforming your passion in a way to change life.
I've tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was doing some research at the time, trying to escape the about of our barece, where we tell others what to do,
And so I walked around the streets for the first year, and I had my first three days of customers. I helped him. He was a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth, and then they got to go and reform, and they said, "You've helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers, and I worked together, and I didn't sell this amazing tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents, but to Japan for sushi for 15 dollars. And then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
I've had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I keep the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- -- so the government says, "Let's do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've been helping 150,000 companies in the process.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go to loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business advisers of history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's visual professor was a philosophy professor before he was looking at companies. Peter's printer said, planning is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the public.
So you build Christchurch, without knowing what the smartest man Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to one.
You have to provide them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they'll come up with a lot of stuff.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the most cheated presentation you've heard tomorrow?
<unk>Typing, passionate people. You hated that one.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- the calculated fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open species of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, to be able to transport, to exchange them.
The technologies don't exist for that.
Who's going to invent this technology for green revolution? Do universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York in 1860s.
In 1860 they came together, and they speculated what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York. The conclusion was, "The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows in this pace, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get the crap done with six million horses.
Because they were already going in crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that's feeding lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive makers in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the backyard.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered discretionionion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all needs to be able to do three things: to sell the market market, which needs to be great, the market market market market to be great, and the financial accounting system has to be massive.
You guess what?
We've never met a single person who can also produce something, sell and take care of the money.
It doesn't exist.
This person has never been born.
We've done research, and we've looked at the 100 ikones in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have, only one thing that's founded by one person.
Now we're teaching 16 year-old entrepreneurship in North Korea, and we're beginning to give them the lectures of Richard Bransons Autobiography, the task of the 16 year-old children, to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons's Autography, as often as they use the word "inheich" and how often the word "we" is.
Never "I" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small professional background in cafes and bars. They're their senior buddy who'll do what someone has done for this gentleman who's talking about this eposi. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting the organization to help them find the tools and to help people. We've found that the wonders of the local population can be changed, that the culture and the economy of that community is only by opening the passion, energy and imagination of the human being.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be in Alice's Wonderland.
So Penn State University asked me -- a Ph.D. for communication -- to try to connect engineers in communication.
I was scared.
Truth. Fear from these students with their large brains and their big books and their big books, I don't trust words.
But when the conversation came along, he took me like Alice, when she got down to the pig's pig and saw a door to a new world.
And I also felt like I was going to get conversations with the students, and I was amazed by the idea they had, and I wanted others to find this miracle country.
I think to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We really need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go anywhere. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religist, and we think, that're in our responsibility as a non-religist, these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
So I want to show you some of the approaches that you can do, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're dealing with, is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well, what?
Say why you're talking about the science realm as relevant to us.
Not only does it tell us that their trails are studying, but also tells us that their phrores, their fatty structure, their bone, are examined in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you'll have copyright dictionary.
Now, the dictionary is a obstacle to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use "discover" and "dterm" in your life, but why don't you just say "space and time," what is much more hopeful for us?
And to make your mind understandable is not the same as to turn your level down.
As Einstein said, "Take things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can certainly tell us something about your scientific field without having to deal with compromise.
So a few things are related to this: examples, stories and analogies, so you can get us in your own way.
And if you present your work, you'll have the points away.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "ide point?"
What happens when someone gets to it? Another one is getting stabbed, and with those dots, you get your audience first.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it's also very much for the wisdom part of our brain, and so we're very quickly challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more potent. It shows that the specific structure of the pigmentation is so stabilized that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple phrase where the audience, once it loses the thread, adjusts, simplify images and graphics, which also helps our other senses to communicate a deeper understanding of what it is that you're describing.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up the door and see the miracleland that celebrates science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the "Nerdin" button in me, I want to sumulate everything with a equation.
Now, if you look at the science and you look at your reference words, it's going to be shared by the relevance, so the audience tells you what's important, and multiplying the whole thing that you have for your incredible work, and it's because of the incredible interactions that are all about new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really really embarrassed.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the country with a cell phone.
You can write a message with a cell phone, and you can start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a phone phone and you can take a song and get famous in sound cloud and famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Time 1984 and I live in Berlin.
So let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going on the street and demonstrated.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all these people who were coming in and asking changes, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phone up, hold it up!
Hold it up. An Android, an Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 points of information.
We have raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.A. has set up a policy.
This is a rule of law enforcement control.
This policy is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service providers all over Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who's calling an email?
Who is going to send a text message to who's going to send a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored on the order of at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are all up and said, "We don't want that."
They said we don't want to have this reserve protection.
We want to have a personal governance in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all said, "We don't want that."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people were pouring out on the streets of Berlin, saying, "Freedom instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be a St. 2.0.
The St. is the St.C. was the St.C. Conwnland.
And I also wonder, is this really working?
Can the really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Declimate Telecom, which was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, will you, give me all the information you've stored on me?
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get a right answer. Only a half Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that's being updated.
So I decided to put a court case against them because I wanted to have this information.
But the German Telecom said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going to take the message back to what they're going to send me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court mandatory decided that the E.U. Recession was a German legal response.
So I got this ugly brown conflating with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 points of information.
First, I saw it, and I said to myself, well, it's a huge file. My drive.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was kind of a bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, "I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to get it published.
Because I want to show people what the water supply is.
So with time and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I'm going to try to track.
And you can even see how I'm driving from Frankfurt to Kumblen, and how many calls I'm going to go.
And this is all possible by this information.
It's a little bit of a fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then they call me some friends, and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up, and you call them, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other what time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a design plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how you can monitor a society because you know who talks to who to talk to who to send an email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said earlier, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, phones had in their pocket.
And the St.S. has known who was at the demonstration, and if the St. was there, if the leaders had been, then maybe this would never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe it wouldn't happen.
And then, not the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it for a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, you say your opponents, just because companies and state places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information that they've stored on you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your own self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: domestic intelligence stores, rapid restaurants, brideops.
So the city map is going to meet and they're going to change the name of South Central to make it happen for something else, and they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Conpatching shops, rapid-gikes, bureaucracy.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the Drive-bys.
The great thing is that the Drive-thrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in curable diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it is in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't really get that out.
And I wondered how you felt if you had no access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, you see the negative impacts that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I realize that the drivemill is bought and sold like the use car fleet.
I see comet centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have any more fun at 45 minutes birthdays to get an apple that's not labeled by pesticide.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call the parking lot.
It's 45 feet in diameter.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to be engaged.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility and I have to stay there."
And I decided to keep it in the state.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, together, and we started planting my food movement and fruit trees, which is the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of executive group, together from gardening from all social layers and from all the city, it's completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically assigned me a plane, and said I have to remove my garden, the supply was going to become a seductor.
And I thought, "Okay, come on, right?
A leader of leadership for growing food fires on a piece of land that you're totally not going to do?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and spoke to the town, and a member of Green Ground Zero. They signed a petition on the front.org and 900 signatures were successful.
We stopped the victory in our hands.
My town even called it, and said they're supporting it and loving what we're doing.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the largest store in the United States.
They have 4,200 kilometers in Brachops.
That's 20 Central parks.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should they not find it OK?
By planting a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
If you have green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my body responsibility, I'm telling people to make their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing their own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more happy to be part of this preconceived reality made by other people, and I make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Homework is my graffiti. I'm harvesting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's been tracking walls, I'm going to wear lawns and plant equipment.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my grading for this stuff.
You'd be surprised what the ground Earth can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as my garden was an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You'd be wondering how children are affected by this.
So gardening is the most therapeutic and sastest act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You also get strawberry straw.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 o'clock in the morning. They were in my garden, and I came out and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason to go out of the road."
I was shocked when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just empowered me to do that. People said, "Fin, you're not afraid people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "For God, no, I don't fear they're going to make something.
And that's what it's like in the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it was just a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people come in and they did all these volunteers.
When kids grow coal, babies eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they're not offered anything about it, if they're not shown how food and body affect them, they're blind, whatever you're going to do.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids who are right on the path that are supposed to be for them, and that's not going to lead anywhere.
I think of the garden as an opportunity where we can train these children to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the soil, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipping container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The genius of sustainability is that you have to stop it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and they're getting the pleasure and the pride and honor to get the privilege of building your own food, and when you open the farmers' markets.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebel, gangster, gang garden gardeners.
We have to turn the image of the sq.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You're going to get a napkin, you know?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you sit in a shower and want to make a meeting where you're talking about making some shit.
If you want to meet me, come with your knees, in my garden so that we can plant some shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nollygoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "snollygoster" means "the unconditional politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher gave a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who is willing to vote on an office, no matter of party, program or performance, and their success of the pure power of the observational consequences."
I have no idea what the task is.
Something about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
So for example, 1771, for instance, according to the British Parliament, newspapers were not able to wipe out the exact same vocabulary of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who began with Parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they rented it, but he was courageous enough to pursue, and finally, he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the phrase "so" of Brass." Many people think.
And you can see the English word is pych.
But that's not true. It's all about a liberation of the press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time when it has just reached independence.
You'd look at the question of, like, "Do you call George Washington, the state of state."
You didn't know.
What do you call the leader of a Republican nation?
And it's been discussed in Congress for infinite lengths.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-city George Washington, and others, the regulators of the freedom of the people of America's United States of Washington.
Not such a thing.
Some people just wanted to call it King.
They thought it was possible.
They were not monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with a little bit of bored, because this debate did three weeks.
I read the diary book that constantly wrote, "I've tried the same topic."
The reason for the delay, and the boredom was that the representment house was against the Senate.
The representment house did not want Washington to be a great thing. They didn't want it.
King calls, and maybe even gives him ideas to follow.
They wanted to give him the most humbling, innocuous title that they thought they were.
This is a cover called "Poir."
President. They didn't invent the title. He just meant someone to have a meeting.
Something like the precaution of a jury.
He had no longer the size than the award "s-scientity" or "a-cater."
Sometimes there were a couple of second presidents of small colonial and government groups, but it was really a uniremark title.
That's why the Senate refused to take it away.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it to President.
This guy has to sign the agreement and hit foreign vigaries.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't come.
Instead, they were meant to be the name of the word "dinal" in the face, but they wanted to make sure that they didn't agree with their own honest respect for the opinions and the methods of civil nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, that the state of the preservation of the preservation is not necessarily validated -- the preservation of preservation of the preservation of the presidency, and the United States of the United States.
You can learn three interesting things from it.
First, and I think that's the best thing -- I think I couldn't figure out if the Senate ever confirmed the title of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has only awarded the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something is temporary -- -- -- then you'll wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is not so humbling, right?
It has to do with something more than 5,000 nuclear weapons that it has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title size.
And so the Senate ended up in the end.
They got a respect title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the meaning of self-interest -- well, it was this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147,
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate and the representation of the House, because nobody feels humbling if you're told you're the president of the United States now.
And that's the most important thing you can take away from, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the words change much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rebellions at the fight for the jlaalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to sit down my black Concessor's black foot on a pair of brown leatherods and a rocket towards the government regime I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time before, I'd been big with war, but next to Pyjama party and football games and rebel with racist Southeasts and heroist protesters, who had no one to tour with communism and live Afghanistan, and to tap on burntate records before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here to stand here, a felt Afghane, South-state of Godzaden. An atheist and a radical political artist who has been working for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So there are a lot of really awesome things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainglows. I want to make art that would spread the personality and inform authority and rewriting the reality and even the design of a kind of imaginative people to try to figure out the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of jihad, which is the jihad of the communist, like "Pop Star Bling," and used armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihadiest number, when Parliament is supposed to take a job and do a choice campaign with the slogan, "Take me! I do jihad, and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to break this viiis that are used as a national hero.
I want to go to the bottom of corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "reach," where you're going to be a police department, put a false control on the streets of Kabul, and keep cars on the streets of Kabul, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money to them, and in the name of the police department, they're apologizing to them, and they hope that they accept 100 percent of us.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my opinion, the Intermodic conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a forensic for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine the furs of local Afghan clothes with a protective or multiple kets into a fashion-nea-friendly tripum.
And I'd like to see what a simple pusher looks like from Kabul between Kiplings Appellell, in 1899 to create a dialogue about how today's development organization is going to have its roots on its past-down rhetoric about "The White Army" to protect the brown man from themselves and even even a little bit to certify it.
But for all these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood, they can't be misrepresented.
But I do, because I have to because of the geography of self.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for some time, I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, that's exactly what it said.
I feel like now, there's a very awkward tension in the room, because I should not have been wearing this dress.
Fortunately, I have something to do with change.
This is the first time someone is going to be on the TED stage, so you can appreciate being happy to see this, I think.
If some women were really excited when I came out, you don't need me to say this, I'll read this later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in a very short 10-second, what you think of me.
And that's not the chance everyone has the opportunity.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you'll all be fired by me, so you're not going to do anything until it's above my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, hopefully it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
A image is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to smuggle my back and put my hand into the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the false brine that I took two days ago to work, there's very few ways to change our utterness, and our utterance -- even though it's super-versable -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless is to be honest today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a good white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and you might ask yourself what this legacy is.
Well, in the last few decades, we have defined beauty not just as healthy and primitive and symmetrical in which we are mechanically programmed, but also as big, pounding, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's an legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion masteres from, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu."
And first, I'll comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student of NYU counted all the modules on the runway, each one of them being executed, and that of 677-tested modules were only 27 or less known as four percent.
The next question I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And I say first of all, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja Conacher, which would be completely wrong, because then you'd be the first one."
If you still say after this amazing bias, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "She my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the president of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like you want to get the Jackpoter in the Lotto.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career path.
Now I want to show you 10 years of model fiction, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be unfolding right now.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is just there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a photo to run," well, the leg first, beautiful, long, long, long, this arm goes back, this arm is on the front, and the head is up to three feet, and you just get back, and so you can see his friends back up, 400 times.
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less odd than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and have a life run, and you've done some jobs, you can't tell much more. If you say you want to be President of the United States, but in your lifetime, "10 years of underwear," you'll be looking at weird.
The next question I'm often asked is, "Whoevers all the photos are stored?"
And yes, pretty much all the photos are stored, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the very first photo I did, and that was the very first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my period at the time.
I know this is going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this movie.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days before a magazine for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V- magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you'll see that these images are not images of me.
They're constructs, and they're a group of professionals, Hairstylists and remixers and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and their pre-profinement. They're not. I'm not.
Okay, so next thing, people always ask me, "Well, did you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-m-m-S- shoe shoes I can't carry, except the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I forgot my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was walking over a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took a "Excuse me, Mr. Words," and we could go on.
I've got these free things about my appearance, not because of my personality, and there are people who are paying a lot of money for their appearance and not for their personality.
I live in New York, and I live on the 140,000 teenagers who have been shot and filtered last year, and 85 percent of black and Latino, and mostly young men.
It's only 177,000 young male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question: "Am I stopped?"
But, "How often am I going to pause? When am I going to stop?"
And in my research, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is 78 percent when they got 17.
The last question I've ever asked is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think you'd expect this answer to, "If you're a little bit thin and glitter hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backstage, we'll give a answer that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of that is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never said before the camera, what I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Do I have happier if I had thin legs and glitter hair?"
Then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest puppies, and they are the ones that are probably uncertain women on the planet.
When I've been preparing this talk, it seems really hard to get a honest balance, because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable about going, and saying, "I got all the benefits from a stack that was piled to my favor," and it doesn't really feel very good at me, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was very difficult to really open up a legacy of harassment and race when I'm one of the biggest suppers of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great that, before I've done this here, before 10 or 20 years or 30 years of time, my career has been still filled, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I've paid college, which is so important.
If you take something out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misguided successs and failures more.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother, who has come to life in exile: "Son, paddafi Resist. Bearch it.
But never become something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's now been nearly two years since the Libyan revolution has been broken by the waves of mass mass mass destruction in both of the Tunisian revolution.
I connected with many other Libyers, inside and outside Libyens to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gadaffi.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, Libby women and men stood in the first row, they asked the end of the regime, they held slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They proved an excellent mutant by placing on the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They showed a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the far west, all the way to the South.
Finally, after a six-month period of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we were able to liberate our country and to reduce the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a great official, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for movement.
Over four decades, Gaddafis tyrannic regime has destroyed both infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
I knew the devastation and the challenges, as so many other women, re-growing the civil society of Lybacia, and we asked a mandated and unfinished transition to democracy and national justice.
Naheto to 200 organizations have been founded right during the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of exile, I came back to Lybia, and with some unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to the subject capacity of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Libyians, a leadership of women, leaders of various life-surial experiences, whose goal is to meet public liberalization for women, and to our right for equal jurisdictions for democracy and peace creation.
In the election, I met in a very difficult environment, a environment that was vastly polarized, a environment which was shaped by the selfish political politics of dominance and execution.
I led an initiative to help women have a foundation of peace, to achieve a policy policy, a law that any citizen, no matter what the back to vote, to vote for the right, and to take a job for political parties, and especially to put a link between male and female candidates on vertical and horizontal level and competitive levels and make a gift to make a complete issue.
At the end, our initiative has been taken over, and it's successful.
Women won 175 percent of the national jurisdictions in the first elections since 52 years.
But it was clear, but surely the history of elections and the entire revolution for <unk> because every day we started to turn new messages to violence.
We went to the Suguation of ancient mosques and Sufi leaders.
On another morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then another morning, the wounded were signed by the army victims.
And really every day, we've been looking at the tyranny of milititers and their ongoing challenges against human rights prisoners and their neglect of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind, polarized and distant from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they had at the beginning.
Intuse, irregular, revenge became the icon of the <unk>Folge Time of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our pressing list and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to confess that as a nation, we've made false choices and false decisions.
We set our priorities wrong.
Because elections did not bring peace or security to Lybia.
Has the re-expilling list and convergence of female and male officials led peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why is it that our society will continue to polarize and dominate the tyranny and the purpose of women and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones that were missing, but the female values of compassion, the Gardade and the one who was.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus gap as it needed the election that ultimately strengthen the polarization and reproduction.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting on behalf of anger and calling a day of revenge.
We have to start acting on behalf of sympathy and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just claim the next values, but also it's also that it's very much like Rade instead of collaboration, cooperation instead of composing a competition,
These are the ideals that desperately need one of the dusted lybia to get peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in this alchemy, it's about the relocation of feminine and ceminial view.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do this in existential terms before we do it socio-Indically.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam" -- "Ly God's word, raping the word of the Good God.
The word "raheem" again, which is known in all the abrally traditions, has the same Arab root as the word "rahem" symbolized, symbolized the maternal feminine, which surrounds all humanity from the manhood and the female, all of which tribes have gone from all the tribes and all the tribes.
And just like the mother's mother's mother's heart, which grows in him, it's so much to keep the basic of compassion from all.
And so we were told, "My Gnade is all about things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade was prelimited in front of my brilliance."
Anyone want to be saved by the giah of the Gnade.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought, my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the song "non to treat."
And I was very proud.
In school, we applied the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until something changing time.
At age seven, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother took a letter from the sister of a colleague of mine.
And he said, "If you guys here, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore because we've been eating nothing anymore for two weeks.
We're all stuck together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're soon going to die."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly after that, I went past the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A pine woman was lying on the ground, and a her mother was crushed in her arm, slipped helplessly to his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were all engaged in caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-1990s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were killed to victims, and many more people survived because they ate grass, beetles and tree canopy.
Lowies became more and more and more and more likely, so that at night, everything was worse to me, except for the lights of China on the other side of the tag we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the amp, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very stunned, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of deaths.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can say that during the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought that for a short period, I would be separated from my family.
I never thought it would take me 14 years to get back together.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have any idea of what life would be as a Northan refugee refugee, but soon I realized that it's not only extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because Northan refugees are seen as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in silence that my true identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police police police and sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be Northan female, so they tested my Chinese records and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid of this, and I thought my heart would explode.
If there is anything unnatural, I could be imprisoned and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the poll, a official said to the other one, "That was a false failure.
She's not a Northan woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are employing messages called foreign messages, but many are caught by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they were caught, they were finally released by immense international pressures.
These North Koreans did not have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are rejected, and they are executed, imprisoned, or they are locked up in public.
Although I was lucky at escape, many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle to survive.
After they've learned a new language and they've found work, their world can be put on their heads in a moment.
And after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life again.
In South Korea, I think, was a bigger challenge than I thought it was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I also noticed the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very divergent, because of 67 years of division.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northananian lady?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the adaptation to the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show at the university.
Just as I became more common in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Koreans have started the money I sent out of my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to relel in a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to go through an incredible route on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself go to the Northan border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I needed to run it, on more than 2,000 miles from China, and then South Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we've been caught almost a number of times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they'd be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed, and told him they were a hermit mug, and I was her connotary.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We've managed to get it to the laatian border, but I've had to put almost all my money in order to get the border control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family has been imprisoned because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and cash money, my family was released within a month, but shortly after that, my family was replicated again in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to protect my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went back and forth between the foreign authorities and the police department, trying to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back the cash money or money money money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the man's voice asked me, "What's going on?"
I was quite surprised that a foreign stranger is looking for it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without shooting, he went to a bank machine, and he paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him about the whole heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the Northanian people."
And I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger has shown me a new hope that the North Koreans have so desperately needed, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope-free population, the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back in South Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, learning English, professional education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world because many of us still remain in contact with family victims, and we'll send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I hope to devote the peaceiest North Koreans to success, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see more successful North Koreans around the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I have just one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big, very good sight.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it irresponsible, and he shares it indiscriminately.
It's not stupid. It doesn't stop the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to think about words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
It has absolutely unfinished memory.
But he has a selective one.
He can't remember if he's stolen my chocolate pill, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, talking about four of us when he was the first result of the teoonbies on my arm, and he's a lady's birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds are not acting in the social version of normal, they're often being replicated and understood wrong.
But what motivates my heart and strengthed my soul is that although that was the case, although they were not seen as usual, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that affect social communication, learning and physical skill.
It's different in each individual, so Remi is different from the same as Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes, it's observed in a new person of autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing interventions in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've ever met autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He screamed a lot.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and reigned in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, putting the washing machine in and eating everything that was coming out of him.
And when he grew older, he became different, and the differences became apparent.
But behind the anger and the raz, and the hidden hyperactivity was something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been lieded.
Remarkable.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of my parents who I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things that I'm not going to want to trade against normality.
Normal is the beauty that gives us differences, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another way of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it. And in all fairness, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is what we're trying to do with someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been doing us with awe and curiosity, and this photo on a project made an apple, and it's a catalyvon-long caton-long cat.
But now, 50 years later, we're faster, and we're not seeing the world with a million or a billion images, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create a slow motion record of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look outside of our viewpoint to see corners or see an <unk>-ray in our body and really question what we mean with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it out into a billion second -- this is several-seconds -- I create a package of photons that's barely a millimeter wide, and this photon pack, this project will move on to the speed of light, and as I said, a million times faster than a second.
So, if you take this project, take this photon pack and put it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So, this whole event.
So, think of it, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotardiogram -- as long as the light to go back this lane -- but I'm going to try to slow this video down to the order of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So, this is a film that happens a lot, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, is going to be put in the bottle with a photon pack that starts to move through and eventually breaks the inside.
Part of the light is flowing outwards to the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
Many of the photons eventually achieve the plumbing of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble there that's sweeping around the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflective events you see that the reflections are focused on the end of the bottle after some images.
Now, if you take a normal project and let it go back the same route and slow the video back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project of motion.
And what about a still life photographer?
You can see again how these waves are going to wash up the table, the tips and the wall over the background.
It's like when you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed to me as though nature is painting a picture like this, each of which is a fato-screen image, but of course our eye is a set of frames.
But if you look at this Tomate again, you'll see that when the light is sweeping the Tomate, it's going to keep going to keep going. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is coming up and the lights jumps in it and comes back to a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is installed in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you could go into a supermarket and find out whether a fruit is a fruit can go away without even touching them.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo of short air time, you have very little light, but we're putting a billion times faster than your shortest initial waste time, so you're not getting anything as good as any light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon pack, a million times, and we're going to draw this back up with very clever synchrony synchronization, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do some really interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superhero: to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to cool a little bit of light on the door.
It's going to be clamted, it's going to go into space, and part of it's going to bounce back to the door, and eventually we could use this more repetitive of light.
And this is not rocket science fiction. We've actually done it.
On the left you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall, there's a puppet hidden, and we'll be able to put the lights on the door.
After our paper was released in the "Nature Communications," it was taken out of Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light project, and they're going to slide on this wall, and this photons pack is being poured in all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will then let the light back, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light, and then a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but it's going to be very interesting in time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique capacity.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And that, of course, is because we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is to what distance it is.
By lighting a laser, we can take a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but then we can take a lot of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the various light puffs, then we can see the object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a lot of work to do before we can put this into practice, we could use cars that avoid collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can search for dangerous adults by looking at light through open windows, or we can build endcopes that see the body around Okkocopes and also see the powdering.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is a very challenging thing, which is why this is really a call for scientists to think about Femto photography, because a new imaging process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, science has become an art, an art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we're collecting every single time, not just the scientific design process. We can also create a new form of computer photography, interlimation, and color manipulation, and we can only look at that wave between the time.
But there's something funny about it.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we, because we have almost in the speed of light, have strange effects, and Einstein would have seen this image incredibly happy.
The sequence of events in the world appears in reverse order, so by applying the range of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So whether or not, for photography, whether we're going to focus around or create a new representation of technology or new exhibiting, since our invention has enabled us to open up all the data and details on our website, and hope that the "pasterers," the creative community will tell us that we should stop to re-to-the-frame interfaces, to start the next one-dimensional representation of the cameras -- and to start the next one-to-frame, and to
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor in the street so many conversations are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors, and use things like stickers and cartilage and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How do we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned building and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is tied from the huge oak that has been filled with loved ones for hundreds of years, drunks and dreoths. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time anyone never gets to it, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the remains in America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I could get it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpectedly.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that are now important to me in life.
But it's hard for me to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose your daily lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a giant board and I wrote a wall of holes, "If I die, I want to die, I want to -- everyone who can come back, take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it grew and kept going.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the people on the wall.
"I want to be sued for piracy."
"In the last time I die, I want to stand on the cutting line on the International Recession."
"First I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"In the first time I die, I want to plant a tree."
"In my life, I want to live on "weak."
"I want to die before I die, I want to keep it in my arms."
"I'd rather die, I want to be a cavalry."
"In my previous life, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to cry, to cry, to moll me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new way, in a more and more meaningful way.
It's about creating space for you and thinking and remembering what's most important in our own growing and changing.
I've done this last year, and I've got hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a construction kit, and now have been built in the world like Kacan, South Africa, Argentina, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces if we have the opportunity to stand up and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and fragile.
We're often stopped talking about death or just thinking about it, but I realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthens us most.
The idea of death illustrates us of life.
Our common places are the best things that we can do as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and our fears and stories, people can't just help us to create better places around us, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in this idea of math, which is a special problem for everyone who is involved in the targeted mathematics, is that we are like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing.
And dancing is one of the most human activities.
We are thrilled to see the master ballet and beats of the dolphin, as you'll see.
Now, the ballet is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental signal that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slow down this extraordinary ability. It also does it with my rented Jan Strival, who was a ballet failure at the time.
Over the years, you've done a lot of advances in treatment.
Yet, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this illness, and they have to live with the inevitable symptoms of weaknesses, tremor, adultery, and others that cause this disease, and that's why we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress objective, and ultimately, the only way to know whether there is a cure if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
In trouble, there's no biomarkeral chemistry for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that there is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies, it's never done. It's never done before.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't have to be a corporate hospital.
It's actually 300 percent, by the way, to investigate in the neurological department.
So I want to suggest to you a unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a sense, virtual wireless like my Iranian address.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This is what happens in the healthy state, if someone is making a speech, we can look at it as a coherent ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all of these vocal organs if we can make sounds, and we have all the genes for it.com1, for instance.
And how ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn to talk.
And by saying that we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and so the way the limbs are affected by Parkinson's vocal muscle.
On the bottom record, you can see an example of irregular vocal fones.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Trueness, weakness, perseverance.
The language is even becoming a bittern and a wiper, and that's an example of the humor.
Now, this impacts on the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision manipulation software combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now now tell where someone is in a spo between disease and health, just because of the vocal sounds.
So how do we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test is in neurologists.
It's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And they're both accurate. They're not really being done by experts.
So they can be done by their own.
They're very fast, they're at the peak of 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in a large scale.
So we can do this amazing goals.
We can reduce logistic difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to perform routine control control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through the conventional observation.
We can do low-cost massage approaches for clinical trials and can be able to implement the entire population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's headquarters.
With Aculab and patient'sLike, we want to take a very large number of voices around the world to have enough seed data for the success of these goals.
We have reputation numbers that are accessible to a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who, with no Parkinson's, can be buying cheap to leave images for a few cents. I'm very familiar with joy that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of them, say 10,000 people, you can tell who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to tell in the caller's phone whether or not, OK.
Some of you might not get to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in a variety of circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are to exploit them to figure out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's.
Right now, their 86 percent accuracy is true?
It's much better.
My student Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done such amazing work -- has shown now that it's working on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a better improvement.
That means that people can -- people can call the phone and do the test. People could call it to Parkinson's, send their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya at the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and that's behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in the South, in a way, in a way, that means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, they follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night, and I woke up in the morning, and I found them dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buest.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we came together with our animals and our openland habitats, and that's why our animals mean so much to us.
I've been a kid who was only a woman who was a victim.
Our warrior's name name. They protect our tribe and our loved ones. They're also brought to this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park there's only so few lions.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for the cows of his father, and so did it.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this would not really help us, but to help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried to use a bird belt.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow.
But lions are very clever animals.
You'll see the bird belt come back and go again, but the next time, they come and they say, well, the thing doesn't move, that's still there.
And they reach out and kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the bar. I walked around with a tap in the hand, and the lions didn't catch up.
lions fear light, which moves.
I had an idea.
I've been working all day in my room, and I've even taken the new radio, and I'd actually take my mom's new radio, and the day she'd barely come around me. But I've learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a control station from a motorcycle. It suggests whether you want to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off.
This is a little leaf from a broken pockets lamp.
And then I built it all together.
The solar panel is integrating the battery, the battery is providing electricity to the control plant. I call it a transformer.
And the driver's policy is bright.
You can see that the eaves show outwards, because it's where the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights blink, and the lions believe I'm walking around the bar, and I've been in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our homes, and since then, we have no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they're really good at work.
My idea is now used all over Kenya, including for other predators like hyena or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to give me a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is dedicated to fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights where there's no other, and I'm showing people how to use them.
A year ago, I only had a boy who was chewing cows from his father, and I saw planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one day!"
And here's where I am.
I was allowed to get a ride with an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a pilot engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to hunt lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions in common. We can live side by side with lions without argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship now. Yes.
They work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. An electric fence?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, don't you, yes, I've tried it before, but I've given it back to the test because I got a blow.
It's all hard. Richard Turder, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you on each step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in your hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and none of them have done.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting was seen.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story begins when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I held my daughter on her first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and fiveth birthday.
And so one year later, we went back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this is going --
When my daughter's third birthday came up, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina to New York and do it a father-boyfriend's boss to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to have a whole stranger to take his camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately nobody is ever going to bat with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a given moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us to keep time in October and change time and how we move from year to year, not just physically but in everything.
Because although we always make the same image, our perspective of time changes, as they're reaching new milestone, I can see life with their eyes as they deal with everything, and as they see it.
This very intense time we spend with each other is something we value, and we expect for a year.
Last, during one of our trips, we walked around, and suddenly it remained as if, it shows up on a red bar on a tomato store, which they learned as a little child, at the earlier travel.
And she told me about their feelings that she thought was five-year-old at the exact same point.
She said she remembers her heart going out of her chest when she saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks at New York in New York because she really wants to go to New York.
And I realized that, the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like in you, but besides those 15 images, I'm not on a family photo.
I'm always the one who makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come to the image and not ask someone, "Would you like to have a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 27.20, 58.1/34.9/22.3/14.6 (BP=0.954, ration=0.955)
