When I was 11, I was a morning of the sounds of the sounds of a little joy.
My father heard that little, gray radio show on the BBC.
He looked very happy about what was kind of unusual at the time, because he was mostly depressed by the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'm never going to forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban put the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so I was stalled for five years as a boy and I was very upsetting my older sister who couldn't help alone to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to guess where no one could guess where we went.
We've been hidden in our books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just going to go shopping.
We've been doing a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was kind of a bit suspicious in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And again, the class had to be rejected for a week, because the Taliban had signed up.
We never were sure how much they knew about us.
Did they stop us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education became more important and daughters were identified.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
And he was a foreign of a province of Afghanistan. He insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and he was rejected by his father.
But my mother was trained.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to transform our house to school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- was the first person in his family who ever received a education.
And it always seemed to me that his kids would have a training, even though their daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He saw it as a much greater risk to send his kids not to school.
I still know that in the late year, I was frustrated by our lives, by the unconscious fear and the perspective of the interpurity.
I had a good joke to give up, but my father said, "Tear, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be displaced in war from your house.
But one thing will always stay you: what's in there, and even if we have to pay your blood to your school, we'll do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have a higher degree than the high degree of college, and if my family hadn't been so much for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm here today when I'm a proudly undantin at the Middlebury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was rejected by his family, because he announced to send his daughters to school, one of the first ones that I've been discouraged.
He's not just stumbling with my graduate degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the one who runs him through Kabul.
My family believes to me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
And so I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for women education.
And so I helped to start to start ROLA, and maybe even the only department for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students at my school want to perceive all of them who are given to their individual opportunities.
And see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as well as my parents for me, despite all the deceptions of their own.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed's the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they're the death of a bomb on the street just for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang, and he threw his voice, if he sent his daughter back to school, she would try again.
He said, "You know, if you want to be told me, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter on the game because of your old and discriminating ideas."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that is often left in the West: the back of most of us who have success, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that's aware that their success is also its success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not going to be a critical role in our success.
They're often the ones that are highly expressive and persuasive to the individual future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is unaware of the support of men.
And under the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, over three million girls are taking the lunch bank.
Afghanistan appears to look like America, like that.
Americans recognize how uncertainty these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not the duration and changing with the United States population.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them to respect them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unconceable opportunities, and remember every day, the girls who visit SOLA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, including a living -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, -- I see it young, but not -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia projects with the technical collaboration with African countries.
I've been working for an Italian NGO, and every single project that we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought, 21 years, we're a modern human being and having good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book "Railers of Zambehenory," was one of the people we wanted to show in Italy to be able to build food.
We came to the 19 seed seeds in the Southeast, in this gluten valley, which leads to Samei River, and we taught the local population of the local population of the growing-aged tomato and the mchini and ...
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no agriculture in such a plant of crop.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here!"
"Mait time to save people from the Sambica before the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this super-pressive tomato. In Italy, they became so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the Sambers, "Look, how just agriculture is."
When the tomato gas rose, and the red was shown overnight, about 200 pilars came out of the river and yell everything.
We said to the sambers, "Oh God, the nilber."
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were in Italy so great in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French people did, what I saw, after I saw what they did, I was pretty proudly proudly on our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the neck of the neck.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we have the unhealthy African people.
They should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a cross-American economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been raped.
Just read your book.
Check out of an African, what we've been doing.
We are Western people, colonialists, missionalists, and there are only two ways that we deal with people. We colonize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I train every other culture as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronisis: I train every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bancy," head.
I was a happy one when I read the book "Sallive Beesy" by the Shoodle. He said, especially in the economic development, if people don't want help, they're going to let them stay alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
And this is the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not a neococolic?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people and created a system called a company that never gets a little bit, never gets motivated, but you're going to be a service of local passion, the local public and the local people who have a dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you keep your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put them together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We make ourselves in cafeteria. We make ourselves in a pungeip.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like this person, what do you want to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important of humanity.
We help them find knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, what they should do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You know, entrepreneurs never have a part, and they're never going to say in public, what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Recessing this light.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never seem to be in public meetings.
We work to one to do that, to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the hospital of the company, the hospital of the operating community that sits in your house with your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the means of changing your passion in a way that life is going to be alive.
I've tried this in a water-in-fervice, Western Australia.
I was a little reluctant to go back and try to escape the crushy flaws, where we say other things that they should do to escape.
And so I went through the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, my first customer, I helped him to get fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen came up and said, "You've helped the Maori to help us?"
I helped these five fishers to work together and not sell these amazing tuna in Albany to 60 cents to 60 cents, but to Japan for Sushi for 15 dollars. Then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them help us?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How are you doing that?
How do you do -- I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Let's do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've been able to build 50,000 companies in the process.
There's a new generation of companies that are tracking loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers of history died in 96 years ago.
Peter Cochrane was a professor before he was involved with a business programmer: Peter's printer said, in fact, planning is incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Recess is the death penalty spirit.
So you build Christchurch, without knowing what the smartest human being of Christchurch is going to be with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to a place.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they'll come up with them.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the most fun you've ever been doing tonight for today?
<unk>Audience, passionate people. They hated you.
I want to tell you that entrepreneurship is the right way to do it.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the news-based fossil fuels, manufacturing, and all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
The fuel engine is not sustainable.
The open-of-life realm is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, channel, transport, and sub-cognify them with them.
The technologies don't exist for this.
Who's going to invent this technology for the green revolution? Do you forget it?
The government? Remember it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a great story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in 1860.
In 180, they came together and they made them specified, which would happen in a hundred years with the city of New York City, and the conclusion was a non-focus: the city of New York won't exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows in that pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get the weight of six million horses.
Because they went in crap.
Thirty60 they see the dirty technology that keeps life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there was 1001 automotive manufacturer in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology has made the race. There were tiny little factories in the backlands.
Dearly, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered to disclosion.
They don't come and talk to you.
And next, you have to offer them absolute, committed and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, everyone has to be able to perform three things: to sell the product that needs to be great, great-pitite, and the financial public public public needs to be massive.
Do you guess what?
We never met a single person who can produce something at the same time, sell and sell for money.
That's not what it doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We've done research, and we've looked at the 100 ex-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-art companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westhouse, Edison, Ford, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have been called, only one: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16-year-old entrepreneurship in Northeast, and we start to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons of Technology. The task of the 16-year-old is to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons's biography, how many of the word "impemal" use "so" and how many times the word "so" is."
Never "I" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small professional background in cafeteria and bars and bars. They sit in their possession of what someone has done for this gentleman who's talking about this Eposi. Somebody's going to tell you, "What's going to need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you like me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting the company community experts to find the tools and the people, and we found that the moral intelligence of the local population that the culture and the economy of that community can change just by the understanding of the passion and the ability of their own human and their imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be in Alice's miracles.
The Penn State University asked me -- a Harvard to communicate communications -- to create educational education.
I was scared.
Right. Fear from those students with their big brains and their big books and their big books, my non-human words.
But when the conversation developed, he turned me like Alice when she took down to the pig cancer cream and saw a door to a completely new world.
And I felt like I was doing conversations with the students, and I was amazed by the idea that they had and wanted to find that other miracles of this kind of kingdom.
I think it's a great way to open the door, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy and health and health, and if we don't know anything about it, it's not going to go forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-profentionist, as a conversation.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles country.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
I want to show you a couple of ways that you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're busy with you, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to us is, well, and so?
Tell us why just your scientific territory is so relevant to us.
Not only do you think of your fingertips, but also tell us that their pores, the little structure in our bones, are studying, because it's important to understand oatoposis and treat them.
And if you tell what you do, then you have preventable words.
In other words, there's a barrier to understanding your mind.
Sure, you could use the "talk" and time, but why don't you just say "a- space and time," what's much more senseful for us?
And we understand your mind to make sense of understanding is not the same as you can measure your level.
As Einstein said, "Ball things like this -- but not simpler."
You can imagine something about your scientific territory without competing tradeoffs.
Some things are indicating: examples, stories and analogies, and so you can pull us into your flour.
And if you put your work in, you can take the dots away.
Have you ever wondered why it's called "Ride point?"
What happens when someone else gets to mind? Another one is getting married, and with those dots, you know, your audience.
And a slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits too much to the conversationful part of our brain, and by doing so, we're very quickly challenged.
This example of Gene Bonve Brown is a lot more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the body of the body is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, easy sentence, a simple sentence where the audience can lose the thread, and it can adjust images and graphics that also express our other senses, and it creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up the door and see the wonder country that promises science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the "The Lore" in me, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
And if you look at your science and you look at your pre-conceptions, you share these through the meaningful things, and the audience tells you what's important, and multiply the whole thing with the passion that you have for your incredible work, and it's getting out of the un-enable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really interested in it.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can write a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can put it up on sound cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back into this city.
And you can see hundreds of thousands of people going to change the road and demonstrated them.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we've been to imagine that all these people who were being collected and asking changes, had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold on your cell phone, keep it up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.88 lines full of information.
We have raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.R. Recess has signed up a line.
This is a rule of law enforcement control.
And that's the rule that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in the entire country has to store a range of users of Gureetial information.
Who calls? Who calls an email?
Who is sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to access to this reserve.
We want to store self-of-the-dimensional standards, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of these information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests who all said, "We don't want to."
And you can see tens of thousands of people coming up on the streets of Berlin and said, "Solerance instead of fear."
And some of them said that this could be a to the Dallas 2.0.
The mask was the Grand Hemino police department in East Swoodland.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can all of this information really store over us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the <unk>-ray telecom, which was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them to say, please, all the information you've been carrying over me.
And I asked her once, and she asked her, and she didn't get a right answer. Only blue Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's her slide.
So I decided to put a court trial against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the <unk>"Dagina Telecom said, no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going to take the bill back to what they all demanded to me.
Because in the meantime, the federal court officer decided that the introduction of the E.U. line was a German right-down response.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD, this was what it was.
35.30 points on information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My hand.
But then I realized, after a while, that's my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what should I start with?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to do them published.
Because I want to show people what is a protective control of protection.
So with time and open data City, I did this.
This is an animation of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and down.
You can take any step that I do, track.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt to the train to K<unk> oil, and how many calls I'm going to go out.
All of this is possible by this information.
It's a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then a few friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call them up, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of that.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how you can monitor a society, because you know who speaks to who to who to send an email, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And that information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said to the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of the Los Angeles had cell phones in the fall of 1989,
And the Stasi had known who was in the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leader had been, it might have never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe it wouldn't happen.
And then, not the case of the Ice Shail.
Because today's government agencies and companies want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and fixed.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store all of that much more and long.
But self-detertion and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for the self-interest today.
They have to fight every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not an old age.
If you go home, you say your prostitutes, just because companies and state services have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to the information they've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your self-level policy in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Comular stores, rapid restaurants, refrigeration.
So the city plan is to meet and then survive the name of South Central Africa so that it's different, it's changing it in South Los Angeles, as if it changes something that's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Immed fruit stores, rapid restaurants, refrigeration.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-in-thrus and the Drive-bysys.
The subject is that the Drive-in-eat is more people kill than the Drive-bysys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the seemingly unpredictable diseases.
So, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't even remember that.
And I wondered, how if you had no access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I'm going to find that carriers bought and sold like the carrier.
I see dialogue centers going straight like Starbucks.
And I realized that that's what it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have a joke to 45 minutes of preserving a apple that's not equipped with pesticide.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park plant.
It's 45 feet at the age.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to be engaged.
So I think, "I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility and I have to stay in."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came up and my group, the L.A. Green Grings, and we started to plant my food heat, and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a group of compartmenting out of all the social layers and all the city's social layers, and it's completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else is worried.
The city came to me, and he basically set up a plane and said that I have to remove my garden, the elevator to become a popular configuration.
And I thought, "Well, come up, right?
A message of how to treat food from a piece of food consumption on a piece of land that you're completely different?"
And I thought, "Tool. Herds with it."
Because that time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it and talked to the city of Green Ground Center, and they put a petition on the front of the board.org, and we were successful with 900 orders.
We thought that the victory was in the hands.
My town even called, and said that they support it and love what we do.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most remote spaces in the United States in the city.
They have 1,200 kilometers of real-up spaces.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell should they not find that right?
By the plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my matage message, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
So to grow their own food, it's like printing their own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this preconceived reality that's created by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
So gardening is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's putting the walls, I'm going to fill lawns and park spaces.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my blood vessels for this stuff.
They would be surprised by what the ground can do when you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was being a instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would wonder how kids are influenced by them.
So the therapist's most powerful act of the therapeutic and the most powerful act that you can do, especially in the city.
And you can also get strawbers.
I remember that time that mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 in the night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and I looked like them.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you have to do that.
The garden is not a reason to go on the street."
I was shocked when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just empowered me to do that. People said, "Fin, you don't fear you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "If the devil, no, I don't fear that it's going to be cool.
And it's also on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time I want them to take back their health."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in the downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to bomb the plaster.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it's only for a moment.
Green Gris has already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people who came up with this idea of our own species, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, kids eat carbon.
When they grow tomato, they eat tomato.
But if they don't get any of them, if they don't get them to see how food and body affects, they eat blindly, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids that are just right on the path that they've been looking for, and they're not going to get anywhere.
And I see the kind of sports as a chance that we can train these kids to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a ship container container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free stop, because free is not sustainable.
The fun thing about sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and they enjoy the joy of the pride and the honor of being built into their own food, and when you open farmers.
So, what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want to be that we will all become environmental rebel, gang, gang-class gardeners.
We have to turn the picture of the valleys.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
First of all, you're going to be a little bit of a mugry, you know?
And let's get the gun to your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're sitting in the box of stuff and you want to go to a meeting where you talk about it, you know, make some ticking.
If you want to meet me, you come up with your knees in my backyard so that we can plant any flaw.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford dictionary is "nolly Foster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "Snolly Foster" means "the unfor-profit of politicians."
Even though a newspaper accounter in the 19th century gave a better definition: "A Snolly Folly Fold is someone who is a pre-driving, independent of side, or program, and its success by the pure power of the monumental effect of the aristocracy.
I have no idea what a paper is.
Something else, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
For example, 1771, for example, according to the U.K. parliament, newspapers didn't really get the exact same word of debating.
And that actually went back to the husband of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who went to the parliament.
They threw him into the tower of London, and they gave him a man, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to catch, and eventually he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the sentence "so" in a lot of ways, and a lot of people think.
And so you can see that in the English word is a pch.
But that's not true. It's going back to a government of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are interrupted, I want to take you to the United States at the time that it's just been achieved by independence.
And you saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of the state.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader a representative nation?
And it was published in Congress for almost a long time.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Govern Washington, and others, his highness of George Washington, and again, the propulsion of the human freedom of the United States of America.
Not such a thing.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that was a failure.
They weren't monarchical, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with a little bit, because this argument was three weeks old.
I read the journal book of a funeral that always wrote, "I'm still writing the same topic."
The reason for the ticking, and the boredting was that the representation of the house was against the Senate.
The representative house of the house didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want to give him.
King calls, and it might even be able to get to ideas to their own outcomes.
They wanted to give him the most shock, the most poor, the most cold title that they could observe.
This title was "Pictor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He had previously existed. But he just meant that someone had a board of a collection.
So something like the pre-driving of a jury.
He didn't have the size of the record "The Sames" or "pater."
Sometimes there was a head of small colonial and government groups, but it was a really unmanned title.
And so the Senate refused to give him a break.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it a President.
This guy has to sign up and hit foreign carriers.
Who's going to take him seriously if he has a stupid title like President of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't come.
Instead, you had a voice that's not going to be a case of the "The president" in the book, but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they were not right because of their respect for the opinions of the opportunities and the ways that they're in the Republic of civic nations, whether it's in the state of the state of the state of the state, not the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of
You can learn three interesting things.
One, and I think that's the best thing -- until now I can't figure out if the Senate has ever signed the title of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just given the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
The second thing you can learn is that if a government says that something is temporary -- then you wait at 223 years later.
And the third thing that's really important is that the title of America is that the title is "The Chesent of America's United States today is not so scary, right?
This has a little bit more than 5,000 nucleic flowerheads that he has and the greatest economy of the world and a flout drone of drones and all that stuff.
And reality and history has given the size.
And so the Senate ended up.
They have a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the outbreak of the sin -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear bombs and so forth.
So at the end of the Senate and the representative of the house lost because nobody feels shocked when one said that you're the president of the United States today.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'll leave you with.
Governments are trying to use words to shape the reality and control the reality, but actually changes the reality more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rebel rebel to fight the Moalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to make my black-legged gloves against a pair of brown leather-and-shelf and a rocket in the way that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I've been a war, but next to Pyjama party and football players and football people, and they've been able to deal with the racist Southeasts and the squattery sociiations that no one had to live with the communism and Afghanistan and the way that I knew before I knew what it meant.
But that's the geography of the self.
And so I'm standing here, a more, more friendly Afghans, Southeast of God's Gnades. An atheist and a radically political artist who lived in Afghanistan for the last nine years, and created.
So, there's a lot of great things in Afghanistan that you could do art, but I personally don't like to paint rain-thrases, and I want to make art that connects the personality and stimulate authority and re-interroduce the reality and the actual way that even uses a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of imaginary human-friendly human experience to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- a life where the terrorist is fighting against the community, like "Popififif" and the armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else does the jihad first when the parliament went to the parliament and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Take me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And trying to use this campaign to let these mafiosi who spend as a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan with a project called "The Recession," where you give a police control center, a false control center to the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, giving money to the police department in Kabul, and let them hope that they hope 100 percent of Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the Interformical conflict.
The war and the strange views that came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I put out of the local Afghan arm with a protected or a variety of recycled and a multi-friendly internalized inner-friendly and functional environment.
And I would like to see a simple slap of mine from Kabul, which looks like a simple slipple app between 18999999 to create a dialogue that today's developing state of development-based rhetoric has its roots in the past-down rhetoric of the White Dictionary to protect the brown man itself and maybe even a little bit of preserving them and even a limited to protect them.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misrepresented.
But I do, because I have to, because the geography of self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, just mentioned.
I feel like I've been able to build a kind of unsomqueness tension here in the room, because I wouldn't have to wear that dress.
Fortunately, I've got a little bit more to change.
This is the first time someone meets the TED stage, so you can appreciate the happy to see that I think.
If some women were really embarrassed when I came out, you don't need to tell me that I read later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short seconds of what you think of me.
And that's not everybody has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweats over my head, because you'll all be fired me, so you're not doing anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, I think it wasn't that easy to be as this picture.
So a picture is powerful, but a picture is also flat.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that I should put my back oil and put my hand into the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrong brink that I took for two days to work, there's very few ways to change our "s" and our "s"-like" -- even though it's super-regable and irreversible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless to me is to be honest today.
And I stand on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a pretty white woman, and in my industry, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the more honest way.
The first question is, "How will you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what that legacy is.
Well, in the last few decades, we have just defined beauty as a healthy and a more symmetrical, in which we are programmed biologically, but also as big, mutant, feminine and bright-brae.
This legacy was created for me. And it's an legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashioners might be sent to "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smink. Grand.
And first, I'm commenting your model, you know. It's very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious doctor in NYU has counted all the modules on the length, each single one that was executed, and that of 677-foot-tri interfaces only only only 14 percent or less than four percent of them didn't know.
The next question that always asks me is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can do anything.
You can become president of the United States, or the inventors of the next Internet or a Ninja-brain heart surgeon, which would be completely wrong, because you would be the first one."
If they still say after this great cross-up, "No, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for nothing, and you could be the headman of the American bird cancer, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meel.
And to say that later, you want to be a model, you'd say that once you want to win the Jack Fider in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of a certified model of knowledge, because unlike a heart surgeon, it can only be unfolding.
If there's a photographer, and the light is right there, like a nice flap, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a photo to walk around," so now the leg goes first, and so long, this arm goes back to the back, and you're moving on the head, and you just move back up, and you're going to see 400 eyes, 400, and you'll see, 400 eyes, and you'll see,
It looks like this.
Hopefully less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and you have a space and you've done a few jobs, you can't say much more. If you want to be president of the United States, but in the room, "10,000-day underwear," you'll be looking at weird.
The next question that I'm often asked is, "Who is all the photos that are going to be washed?"
And yes, so pretty much all of these photos are being dunted, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the very first photo I did, and that was also the very first time I carried a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months ago with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this slide.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a Shitching for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V-A magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They're building, and they're building a group of professionals, from Hacentylists and make-upists and photographers and cylists and all their assistants and their post-off production. They're building. That's not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You know, do you have things for free?"
Yeah, I have too many 20-degree gloves that I can never wear, except the things I get free, are things I get to get in real life, and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went into a store, and I missed my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a horrible driver, and she was throwing a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took a "isor, Mr. King party," and we could go further.
I have this free-free stuff because of my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who are listening to their appearance and not paying a high price for their personality.
I live in New York, and I live from the 140 teenagers who were beaten and filtered in the last year, 85 percent black and Latino and most young men.
It's only 177,000 young black and Latino, which doesn't matter the question: "Am I stopped?"
But, "How many times am I going to leave? When I'm going to leave?"
And I found out that when I was a research that I was doing this talk, that 53 percent of all the women who don't like their bodies in the United States don't like their bodies, and that number is up to 78 percent when they've become 17.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they expect this answer: "If you're a little bit thin and glowing hair, you feel very happy and angry."
And backup, we give a response that might be given to this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never say before the camera, which I never said before the camera is, "I feel unconscious."
And I feel unconscious because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Do I feel happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some of the modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest littleest clamies and they are the ones that are likely to be aware of their appearance of the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I've been preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to draw a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to get me here and say, "I got all the benefits from a couple of people who were being pounding." And it doesn't feel very good at me, and it doesn't always feel very good at me, "And that's not always making me happy."
It was very difficult to reveal a legacy of violence and race when I'm one of the biggest payers of it.
But I'm also happy and I feel honored to stand here, and I think it's great that before I've done this here before 10 or 30 years ago, my career has been more and more engaged, because I would probably tell you how I was going to get my first job, or maybe not like I wouldn't tell, like I'm not paid college, which is so important in college.
If you take a little bit out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our distorted and misfort.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, paddafafi resistance. Be,
But I'm never going to be something like a gaddafi revolution."
It's been nearly two years since the Croonian revolution, inspired by the waves of mass mass mass mass mass events both in the middle and in the Egyptian revolution.
I connected to many other species of Elyes, inside and outside of Elyens to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gadastis.
And she was there, a big revolution.
Boy, Gayby women and men stood in the first row, the end of the regime, the Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They proved an explicit mutant by being judged against the brutal dictator of Gaddafafis.
They showed a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east-west to the south.
After a period of six months of brutally violent war, and almost 50,000 deaths, it allowed us to liberate our country and to reduce the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a great servant, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the basis of the course of the course of the course.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannical regime both the infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the gly-in-in-the-the-life society.
The destruction and the challenges that I realized, I renamed as many other women who are building the civil society of Lyiaia, and we asked a legal transition to democracy and national disoriented.
And at least 200 organizations were founded during the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to the relationship to human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Ely Humanians, a movement of women, leaders of various life-to-life communities whose goal is to stand up public to the societic DIY architecture of women, and to our right- right-handed role in the role of the role of the democracy and of democracy.
In the elections, I met in a very difficult environment, a environment that was more polarized, a environment that was shaped by selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I led a mission of the peace platform to get a legal response to a state-contus response to any citizen, no matter what the background should be to vote and to pay for a matter of political relationship between male and female profits and large-scale, horizontal-scale, and to make a constant balance and a discourse to a fixed and a fixed-up.
And at the end, our initiative was taken, and it's successful.
Women won 175 percent of the state-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-year-old elections for the first time.
But it's clearly that the euphority of elections and the entire revolution, because every day we were looking at new messages of violence.
We were looking for a morning to the commander of the late mosques and Sufi leaders.
And one other morning, we received a message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then again, another morning, the suicide bombers were signed by the army.
And we really, every day, we are facing the authorities's rights and their most sophisticated results against the human rights of the human being and their misleath of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary state, polarized, and removed from the ideals and principles of creation, freedom, dignity, social justice -- which they had initially been following.
Consolerance, decency, and rude, became the icon of the <unk>"Dolime of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our disconnection and the elections.
In fact, I'm here to tell you that as a nation who made false choice and false decisions.
We put our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or safety in Lybia.
Did the hard-to-the-step and the change between female and male leadership and national acumen?
No, it doesn't have it.
So what is it?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate by selfish politics of dominance and the permeess of both men and women?
Maybe women weren't the only one who missed, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the one-by-down.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a consensus to be more sophisticated than the elections that have only increased the polarization and the fragmentation.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female as it requires the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop the name of the anger and ask a day of the revenge.
We have to start in the name of compassion and the gouade.
We have to develop a female discourse that doesn't only blame the next values, but also provoke that gouble instead of competition, instead of adding competition, instead of rejecting.
These are the ideals that have to help a war-in-hilled ly-hat to get peace.
Because the peace has a alchemia and in this alchemia is about the causal of the feminine and the masky view.
That's the real thing to do.
And we have to do that in particular, before we do it sociologically.
After a lie from the Koran "Salam," peace <unk> "The word of the Good God's good god, ragle."
The word "rallem" again known in all the late-down traditions has the same Arabic root as the word "in Abrair," and symbolized the matal feminine, which all of humanity, of the male and the female and the female-in-in-the-filled tribes, all of all of the peoples and all of the peoples and all of the peoples.
And just like the mother's heart of the embryo growing in it, it's completely the basic nature of compassion that's ever possible.
And so I said, "My Gnade is all of these things."
And so I said, "My Gnade has been pre-uped before my Groll."
Let's all of us get the space of the Gnade.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Even though I was wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a whole change of anything.
At seven years, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to have to suffer to myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from the sister of a colleague of mine.
And she said, "If you've got this, our five family members will not be on the world anymore because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're all in the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about the first time that people were suffering in my country.
And I was just walking on the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory anymore.
A hot woman was on the ground, and a broken child in her arm turned helplessly helpless into the face of his mother.
But no one helped them because everybody was busy to care for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were attracted to victims, and many more of them survived because they ate grass, beetles and the tree.
So electricity rate became more and more and more, so that at night, everything was so blurged to me, except the lights of China on the other side of the fish that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors on night.
This is the river of the Ivory, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very, very, very, very narrowed, very narrowing Northstans.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies going into the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that during the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought that for a short time, I would be separated by my family.
I never thought it needed 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be as a Northstore refugee refugee refugee, but soon I learned that it's not only very expensive, but also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in the constant fear that my true identity could fly in, and you would send me back into a horrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police police police police police police department and sent to the police department.
Somebody told me that North Bronx worker was to be a non-profession, so they tested my Chinese records and asked me countless questions.
I was so scared, I thought my heart would explode.
If anything unnatural might seem, I could be locked up and valued.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my feelings and answer questions.
After they finished the questions, a officer said to the other people, "That was a false mess.
She's not a North-Actor."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are taking messages to foreign messages calledyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police police and they're being rejected.
These girls had a great fortune.
Even though they got caught, they finally released out of massive international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much fortune.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China, and they're released to North Korea, where they're tortured, or they're being executed in public.
Even though I was lucky at escape, there's no many other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard to survive.
After they learned a new language and they found work, their world can be put on a moment in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was able to let myself go back to South Korea, and I was a bigger challenge when I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I also noticed the difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but in the inside, we've been very different in the inside, and we've been very different from 67 years, because of the part of that.
I was through a identity crisis.
Am I South or North-class woman?
Where am I? Who am I?
And suddenly there was no country that could have been my home.
Even though the adaptation of the Southwest Western life didn't seem easy, I had a plan.
I prepared for the show of the show.
Just as I became more and more successful as my new life, I got a shocking call.
The North Bronx authorities started to take the money I sent my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to be moved to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go back to an incredible route to the freedom of freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between the north and South Korea, ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself back to the northwest border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to hire them to go through more than 2,000 miles through China, and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ship took a week, and we've been nearly caught every time.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of all of all, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought she would be arrested.
When the Chinese officer promised my family, I decided to be determined, and he said she was a rodent, and I was her lock.
He looked at me in a wizic, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to cross-up border, but I had to almost every money to get the borders of Lijuana.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border.
After I paid money and paid money, my family was released within a month, but shortly after that, my family was replicated again in the capital of L.
This was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to resist my family to freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Pacific Embassy.
I went and I went from the foreign authorities and the police department department, and I tried to let my family free, but I had no enough money to pay back and pay money.
I lost all of my hope.
And then the voice asked me to a man, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised to think that a foreign person is interested in it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without a police officer, he went to a bank engine, and he paid the money for my family and two South Koreans to get it out of jail.
And I thank him about the whole heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the North Bronx people."
And I realized that this was an symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger represented a new hope that the North Bronx had so desperately committed to me, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope of the North Koreans who need to need the North Koreans.
After all, after our long journey, my family and I was back in South Korea, but the freedom of being able to gain is just a step.
Many North Koreans are separated by their families, and once they come into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us to learn in education, the English, the professional education and many more.
We can also bridge between the people in North America and the outside world, because many of us still stay in contact with family services, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to be able to democratically enrich the North Bronx with international support.
I'm sure you'll see more successful North Koreans around the world, too, in the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I'm just a request today.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to introduce to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't speak.
Remi knows what love is.
He's sharing them unconventable, and he's not touching them.
He's not a cold. He doesn't look at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, words that I remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has an absolutely un-enquenable memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate sword, but he remembers every song from my iPod, talking about any of my iPod, talking about when he was four, while the first result of the teapet on my arm and his wife's Sips.
Don't you listen to it?
But many people don't agree.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they'll often be understood and wrong.
But what my heart encourages and my soul was that although that was the case that they weren't considered normal, that only one was that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "the Physism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that affect social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a different thing in every individual, and it's so much like Remi's so different than Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes in a new person with autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing-growing treatments in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm in autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very upset.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived in his own world, with its own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things that cars in a row to take their washing machine and eat everything that came under the space.
And when he grew older, he became different and the differences became visible.
But behind the rappings and the frustles and the never end of hyperactivity was a really unique one: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any external, a human who had never been terrified.
Exceptional.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I go back to the idea of things that they've taught me about individual quality and communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
So the normal correlation is the beauty that give us differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of thing that's right.
And if I could only tell a thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be like you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that we have -- we have a gift! Everybody in us has a gift in it, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The opportunity to do the size of scale, progress and change die in the moment that we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
And Doc Edpton has been really excited with awe and curiosity, with this photo, a photo that has a apple that's been absorbed through and with a mass of a half-th-th-th-a-a-a-a-a-a-halfth-a-a-a-a-a-a-half-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-half-a-a-a-a-a-
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femtotoau photography, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can make time-time visual images of light into motion.
And so we can build cameras that are looking down at corners of our view or without a <unk>-ray image in our bodies and really ask what we mean with "Kamera"
Now, if I take a laser clip and I take it into a billionth-by-by-by-by-by-half-second -- these are several-second-second-second-second-up-up-up-by-up-up, I'm making a package of photons that is barely a vertical, and this is a project, it's going to move in light, and I said, "Oh, it's going to be a cost
So if you take this project, this photon pack and you take it into this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So, this whole event -- -- this whole event.
So, you think that this whole event actually takes less than a nanotot -- so long, the light takes to go back to that lane -- but I'm going to add that video to the factor of 10 billion so that you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't funded this research.
So, in this movie, there's a lot of stuff going on, so let me analyze this and show you what's happening.
The pulse, our project, is going into the bottle with a photon pack that starts to move through and then breaks inside.
And part of the light is flowing out on the table, and you see that spread of the waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the elevator and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that's going to be around the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are moving out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflective details are focused on some of the bottle after some images.
Now, if you take a more common project and you let it back the same route, and you can slow it back the video back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little still-time photographer?
You can see again, the waves of the table, the Tomate and the wall on the background.
It's like when you put a stone in a pond.
And it seemed like the nature of this picture, each of which is a photo, each of which is a single-to-up image, but of course our eye looks a set of images.
But if you look at these Tom's Tom's flies, you'll see that when the light hits the light, the light is still going to break down. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom's coming up and the light is running around in it and then retreating back to some billion seconds.
So, in the future, if this Femto camera is embedded in your Camerahandyy, it could be possible that you could go into a supermarket and find out if a fruit is a fruit, without touching them at all.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you do a photo with a short-term outbreak, you have a very little bit of light, but we're going to make a billion times faster than your shortest outbreak of waste, so you'll get pretty much as much light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons pack, a million times, and then we're drawing it back up with very clever synchronizing, and we're combining these gigabytes of data to make this Femto video that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data data and make very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superhero: to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to light on the door.
It's going to be cut into the room, and part of it is reflected back back into the door, and eventually we could use that extra extra lightbulvate of the light.
And that's not a science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
And the back of the wall is hidden a soup, and we're going to let the light go off on the door.
After our paper was published in the "The National Officeications Office," it was taken by Nature.com, and they've created this animation.
We're going to take this light-up project, and they're going to put it into this wall, and this photons are being drawn into all directions, and some of the photons are being able to reach our hidden soup that will break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the light, and then a tiny number of light, and then the photons will come back to the smallest, very interesting, very close to the smallest camera, very close,
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And that's why we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point is about what distance is.
By making a laser a laser, we can record a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- not really make sense, but if we take many of these images, dozens of these images, dozens of these images, and then try to analyze them, and then we can see the different light-tilevered object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've been doing a little bit before we can put that into the lab in practice, we could build cars that can avoid and recognize what's on the curve, or we can look for dangerous populations of survivors by looking at light through the open windows, or we can build end-of-of-the-the-the-lights that can be able to see the body around the right-hand and the right-cho-ch.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's very challenging, and that's why it's really a web call for scientists, now thinking about Femto-Melf photography, because a new visual approach that might actually solve the next generation of medical development problems.
So, like Doc Edpton, even a scientist, the science has become a art of the ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we've been collecting every time, not only in the scientific image. We can also create a new form of the computer photography, with the color-time, and we can only look at all of those waves, and we can look at all of those things between those waves, and we can look at the
But it also happens to be a bit fun thing.
If you look at these waves under the bottles of bottles, you see that the waves move away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've almost been able to cut into light speed, weird effects, and Einstein would have seen this picture incredibly,
The sequence that happens in the world, in the context of events, changes in the camera in a vertical order, so by using the relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter whether it's to focus around images or create a new representation of medical and new forms of applications since our invention has been open and detailed data on our website, and hope that the "Semer Ferersership" and the creative and the research that we have to tell us that we should stop our generation, to start to the dimensions and to start to the next dimensions -- to start to start to the next dimensions and to start to start the next dimensions and to
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that our people can improve our lives.
We don't meet any neighbors on the street so many of the arguments don't come back, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and spets and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much renters pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without giving us each other to each other?
How can we share our memories on the frontest buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the free houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being stalled by the huge osteps that have been friends who have been friends who have been friends who have been friends, and they don't have a showery shadow, and I have a familiar city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever never ever ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city of most of the neighborhoods in America.
I live in this house, and I thought about how I can make it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came out and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a great grateful gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in in in in life now.
But it's hard to keep this view every day.
It's easy to lose your life in the daily world and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I transformed a side of the house into a giant board and I wrote a wall of the gaps: "In the back of the gaps: "I want to die!" Everyone who's coming back, can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and personal hope in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely filled and they grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"If I die, I want to be sued by piracy."
"In my case, I want to stand on the International Recession."
"Let me die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"If I die, I want to plant a tree."
"In my case, I want to live in the webless."
"If I die, I want to keep them in my arms."
"In my case, I'd like to be someone's kava."
"If I die, I want to be myself."
This one was neglected to a meaningful place, and the hopes and the dreams of people brought me to laugh, to wine and sweating me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's in a new way, and it's a new way.
It's about creating space for itself and thinking and remembering what's most important to us while we grow and change ourselves.
I've done this last year, and I've received hundreds of these different messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've been building a buildingbox, and now in countries like Kasazan, Southeast, Australia, Australia, Argentina, and other walls.
We've shown how much power of our public spaces have when we have the opportunity to transcribe our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, looking at things with the right view and thinking that life is close and sensitive.
We're often being rejected to talk about death or even thinking about it, but I realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthen us most.
And the idea of death is that we can visualize life.
Our common spaces show us the best part of what is important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, people can not just help us to help us live better places around us, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm involved in the same math. I'm doing a special problem for anyone who is busy doing math, is that we're like a business worker.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try to explain to you what I'm doing today.
So dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're excited to look at the mastery ballet and the spives of the size of the ball and the bodches that you're going to see.
So, for ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and possibly a fundamental element that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slow down the extraordinary capacity. It also does with my inmates's Muslim Strialime, which was a ballet for his time.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the unconscious symptom of predators, killers, pigity, and other people who live more, and therefore we need to discover objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We have to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately, the only way to know if there is a cure when we have an objective amount of information that might answer this question.
And in trouble, there's no biomarking of Parkinson's disease, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing that's in this 20 minutes of neurologist.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside of clinical studies that it's never done. Never.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a hospital to save a hospital, what if patients could make this test even?
It wouldn't require a labor hospital.
It costs 300 percent to study in the neurological domain.
So I want to suggest you a unconventional method that we're trying to do this, because we're all, in some sense, virtual, virtual, like my god-Bal Gurial Conpime.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This is what happens in a normal state, if someone has a voice sound-like voice, we can look at it as a legitimate ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all of these muscles, if we make it sound, and we all have the genes for it.com1.
And as ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until they're speaking.
And by the contrast, we can determine the position of the vibrating muscles, and as the limb is also affected by Parkinson's brain.
On the lower record, you can see an example of irregular vocal resonance.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
True, weakness, sininess.
The language is even too rich and fuzzy, and that's an example of aymptom for it.
Now, this effects can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and specific analysis, combined with new machine-based learning that's now very advanced, so we can now tell someone who's in a bar between disease and health, just because of the mood of the sound.
How can these tests measure with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test with neurologists.
It's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build a new clinics for it.
And they're all accurate. They're not being conducted by experts.
So they can be done in their own.
They're very fast, they're at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in a large scale.
So this amazing goals can be done right now.
We can reduce logistics difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to afford to run routine control in the hospital.
We can achieve objective data through the conventional observation.
We can do low-cost mass training for clinical studies, and first of all the population is possible.
We now have the opportunity to look for the disease for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this direction, and we're starting to start the Parkinson's disease headquarters.
With a poid and patient's Day City, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough seed data for the result of these goals.
We have a GPS number that is accessible to a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who, with no Parkinson's disease, can buy cheap to leave a few cents for a few cents, and I'm sure that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we say 10,000 people, you can tell who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happened is that the patient has to claim to the phone language, whether this person has Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some might not be able to get it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under various circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we are to assess these to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's Parkinson's disease.
At the same time, their 86 percent accuracy has?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to force him, because he's done this fantastic work -- has shown that it's working on the cell phone network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
That means that people can -- people can call the cell phone and put it into the test. People could call Parkinson's disease, send their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
That's right.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and that's behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a vertical area in the South, which means that wildlife like Zebras can rely on the park at any time.
The predators that are lions, they follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night, and I woke up in the morning, and she found them dead. It was terrible. It was our only snail.
My tribe, the stem of the Maai, believes that we came together with our animals and the Middle Ages of the sky, and so our animals matter so much.
Since I was a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our warrior calls Morans. They protect our tribe and our neighbors. They're also brought to this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years for his father's cows. That's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions who help to see the cows better.
But I didn't get on. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to find it with a bird bird.
I wanted to think that the lions thought I was lying next to the cow's Day.
But lions are very clever animals.
They come, you see the bird records and go back, but they come back and they come up and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still here.
And they take away and kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the bar. I was walking around a cliff around him, and that time the lions didn't get to the lion.
The lion is afraid of light that moves.
I had an idea.
And I was working all day in my room, and once again, I took the new radio of my mom apart, and the day she took me almost about electronics. But I had learned a lot of electronics.
I took a old car battery and a motor station from a motorcycle. It shows if you want to turn up to the right or left. It's shining.
And I turned out a switch to turn the lights into the lights.
This is a little cup of a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar fiber is encoded the battery, the battery is providing electricity to the right-source plant. I call it a transiteator.
And the right-hand control system is blinking.
You can see that the snail is coming out, because they come from the lions.
And that's what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights glow, and the lions believe that I'm walking around the bar, and I was all in the bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our home, and we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lion lions in the background.
Since then, I've been seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they've been working really well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including other predators like hyops or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention was only given to a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helping to participate in donations and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights where there's no other lights, and I'll show people how to use them.
A year ago, I only took a boy from the savanna who was hunted by his father's cows, and I saw airplanes about me and said, "Ein's day I'm sitting in a room!"
And here I am.
I was able to draw a plane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to become a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to beat lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can go together, side with lions, without arguments.
Ash<unk><unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't even know how exciting it is to hear a story like your own.
So you've got this scholarship now. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on a electric fence. A electrode key?
Yeah, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've been trying to do it, not even -- yes, I've been trying to do it for a while, but I've given the attempt to give it back, because I got a blow.
All right, Richard Turder, you're special.
We're going to hire you every step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in the hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and no one of them I did.
There was no kind of director, no styleists, no chance to shoot a picture, no matter how much the lighting was being looked at.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story begins when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture that I gave my daughter my first birthday to my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and five.
And so, just a year later, we were in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this is going out ...
When the third birthday of my daughter said to me, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina to New York and do it a father-class funeral to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking the new tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're having a completely stranger to his camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately nobody is still sitting with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a single moment or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to keep time in October one week and how we change our time and how we think of year after year, not just physically, but in particular, in real ways.
Because even though we do the same picture, our perspective changes from time, as they're always reaching new chunks, I can see life with their eyes, how they deal with everything and how they see it.
And this very intense time that we spend with each other is something we estimate and expect every year.
So, as one of our travels, we went out and suddenly we walked around and suddenly kept them as a result, it shows up on a red bar on a tomato store that she had learned as a little child, at the earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she had thought of as a five-year-old in exactly this place.
She said she remembered her heart of the chest when she saw nine years ago the chair for the first time.
And now she looks in New York to high school because she's really interested in studying in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious way of taking memories.
I don't know what it looks like in you, but besides those 15 images, I'm not at all a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage you to come into the picture of everyone today and not ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
