When I was 11 years old, I was beaten by a morning from the sounds of the sounds of the songs.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show the BBC.
He looked very happy about what was rather unusual, because it's mostly known to the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously very happy to my father.
"Now you can go to a right school," he said.
This morning I'm never forgotten.
It's a real school.
The Taliban put the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
And so I was leaving five years old and I was preparing my older sister who didn't have to stay alone to a secret school.
Only that's how we could go to school.
Every day we took another way so nobody could guess where we went.
We're wearing our books in the carets so that it looked like we'd just go to the store.
We've been doing a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was kind of embarrassing, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were vulnerable to our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then again, the class had to be fired for a week, because the Taliban had been fired.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to fight us?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we were still trying to go to school.
I was fortunate to grow up in a family where education was important and separated by daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign from a remote province in Afghan, and he was in his daughter -- my mother -- to send to school, and was forced to be fired by his father.
My mother was born, but I was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she was in the workforce, just to turn our house into a school and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- the first thing in his family who ever received a training.
And it was always clear that his kids would have a training, even though the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked at it as a much larger risk of sending his kids to school.
I know that I was sometimes frustrated in the Taliban, and I was so frustrated by our lives, by the constant fear of ignorance and the context of the scale.
I had a good joke to give me, but my father said, "Take me, listen. You can lose everything in your life.
You can get stolen. You can be distracted in war from your house.
But one of you will always stay, which is what's inside there, and even if we have to pay your blood for your lunch, we're going to do that.
So -- you're still going to give me a couple of them."
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age, women have a higher degree of college, and when my family didn't have been used so much for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today when I'm a proudly unregor of the New York College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was beaten by his family, because he was given to send his daughters to school, one of the first ones that I've been discouraged to.
He's not just about my high school, but also that I was the first woman and I'm the car driving through Kabul.
My family thinks to me.
I have great dreams, but my family has more and more dreams for me.
And so I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for education from women.
And so I've been able to start to start ROLA, and maybe the only business worker for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to see a great ambition to all of them.
And see how their parents and fathers are facing them, as my parents, despite the end of the rest of the day, and the most vulnerable.
As Ahmed. That's not the really favorite name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter was his daughter, and he was on the home of ROLA in her village, and she's the death of a bomb from the road just a few minutes.
When he got to the home, the phone is shaking, and he's wearing a voice, if he sent his daughter to school, she would try it again.
He said, "I'm going to tell me now if you want to, but I'm not going to put the future to the game of my daughter, because of your old and unconventional ideas."
In Afghanistan, so I've realized something that is often going to be clear in the West: Behind most of us who have success, a father who knows the value of his daughter, and that's the most aware that their success is also succeed.
It's not to say that our mothers are not going to play a very important role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are more sensitive and compelling to the promise of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan is the support of men.
At the Taliban, only a few hundred,000 girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, there are three million girls who are running the bank.
Afghanistan seems to look like America, like this.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not the long, and the rest of the U.S. are changing everything.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, they're going to be the most promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unregulating possibilities, and remember that day, the girls who go to the ROLA.
Just like I have a big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including a living -- my life -- was defined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977 -- I see it's young, but I'm not -- I've been in Sambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, with the technical cooperation with African countries.
I've worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I think 21 years, we thought that we're Italian good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book "Railings of the Zamard, was one of the things we wanted to show in Italian people's Sambias, how food is transported.
We came to Italian seed in South America; in this light-lipped valley, which leads to Sambesi Tower, we taught the local population of the local tomato and the European tomato and the Coini and ...
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they found them.
We were amazed that there was no agriculture in a so-called agricultural forest.
But instead of asking why they don't make any work, we just said, "God is that we're here!"
"Make time to save the people Sambias before the prostitution."
Of course, everything is wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-jilled tomato sauce. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how simply agriculture is."
When the tomato and red got red, about 200 nilters came from the river and yed everything.
We said to the Sambier, "Oh God, the Nilam!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so brilliant in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did what the English world made, what I saw, after I saw what they were, I was pretty proudly proudly in our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the nille.
You should see the stupid -- you should see the nonsense we have not given the existing African people.
They should read the book "Dead Aid" from Dambisa Moyo, she's a cross-state economist.
The book was published in 2009, in 2009,
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been made.
Don't just listen to her book.
You can read from a African, which we've been doing.
We are Western people, Latialists, missionalists, and there are only two species we deal with people. We subbatronize them or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "cater," which means "the Church."
But they have two different meanings.
Romanticist: I'm going to keep myself with any other culture, as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronisis: I'm going to keep myself with any other culture than they were my gay.
That's why white people are called "Laver," the boss is called the head.
I was beaten when I read the book "Sally's "sssy" from the man's "hood", and he said, especially in the economics of economics, if people don't want help help help, then they're going to stay in a quiet.
This is the first principle of help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
Today, Mr. Mr. Teszler, who opened this conference, a stick on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not a neocololololial?
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people and invented a system called business, which is never being launched, but you're never going to be motivated to the service of local passion, the local people who have a better dream to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you're going to put together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet ourselves in Knell.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to close friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can convey someone a little bit of idea.
If that person doesn't like what to do?
The passion to your growth is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important of humanity.
We're helping them to find knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this failure: Why instead of getting into a community and saying that people should do what they're going to do, why don't we hear them? But not in the community-hinning.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
A lot of entrepreneurs have never been part of it, and they're never going to say that they want to do with their money, what they're going to see for opportunities.
Recessing this light.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never seem to be a public meeting.
We're working to do one to do this, a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the company of the company who is the company who sits with you in the house with your kitchen and in the cafeteria, helps you find the tools to transform your passion in a way that's passionate to transform your life.
I've tried this in a life, West Australia, trying to do it.
I was advising time, and I tried to break the brakes, where we say others what they should do to escape.
And so I went through the first year and I had my first two days of clients, and I helped him, he was drinking fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped to sell him to a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen came to the people who said, "You've helped us help us.
I helped these five fish, and I didn't have to sell this wonderful tuna in Albany to 60 cents, but to Japan for SushiK22, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them help us.
I had a year of work. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do -- I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I'm listening to the mouth and listen to them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Let's take it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 50,000 companies in the process of the organization.
There's a new generation of companies who are going to be on loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers of history died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a professor before he was involved with companies. Peter's printer said, design is actually unregulated with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Recession is the death penalty spirit.
So you build Christchill, not knowing what the smartest human being is about to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to one.
You have to offer them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they will come up.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the most shocking thing you've been doing today?
<unk>Audience, passionate people. They're just kidding.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the Industrial Revolution -- the most powerful fossil fuels, the manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The automation engine is not sustainable.
The open-off of the crisis is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, we can use, we can transport, and we can replace them with them.
The technologies are not there.
Who will reinvent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Do you forget!
The government? Excuse me.
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a kind of unconventistic magazine a lot ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of New York in 180, in the year.
In 180, they came together and they made them, and they made them, which would happen in the city of New York City, and the conclusion was a representative: The city would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grew up in this speed, they needed six million horses to get people to the people, and it would be impossible to get the crap of six million horses.
Because they went into crap.
1860s, they see the dirty technology that's going to be alive from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there was 1001dollar automotive cars -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology was made the race. There were tiny factories in the backland.
Doodood, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered by discourse.
They don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolutely, respected and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of us have to do is to sell three things: to sell the product that needs to be super-Doletic, and the financial crisis has to be massive.
Have you guess?
We never met a single person who can produce something, and they can do it, and they can care about the money.
That's not what it exists.
This person never was born.
We've done research, and we've been looking at the 100 e-nant companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wice, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have known, just one: no one was founded by just a person.
Now we teach 16-year-old women in Northland, and we start to give them the first two sides of Richard Brans's Lawography, and the task is the last 12th-old of the 12th-old, in the first two sides of Richard Bransic, the way that he uses the word "I'mood" as often as "the" is the word "the" is the word "the" is the word."
Never "I" and 32 times."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the proman who has a small professional background in the cafeteria and the bars. Their courageous buddy who are going to do what someone's done for this gentleman who speaks about this guy who speaks about this eigity. Somebody tells you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't say." "Do you want someone to believe for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting the company to help them find the tools and the people, we found that the wonders of the power of the local population can be changed, that the culture of the community and the economy can only understand the passion of the energy and the human imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be, that Alice's in the miracleland.
The Penn State University asked me -- a Ph.D. to communicate with communication -- to my learning with communication.
I was afraid.
Really afraid. Fear from those students with their big brains and their big books and their great, I don't know about words.
But when the conversation developed, he was just like Alice, when she was leaving the cancer gun and saw a door to a completely new world.
And I felt like I was talking to the students. I was amazed to the idea that they had, and I wanted to see that other miracles came to this miracleland.
I think that we need to open the door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our greatest problems, like energy and health, and if we don't know about it, it's not going to happen. I think it's in our responsibility as non-profits, these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit ahead.
I want to show you a few approaches, how you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy with is sexy and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer is, well?
Let's tell us why your scientific territory is so relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that their cheeks are studying, but also tells us that their cheles, the little structure in our bones, is critical to understand oatopisicine and treat.
And when you tell that what you do, then you're going to be preventable.
We're talking about a barrier to understanding your mind.
Sure, you could use the "ne" and the time" and the time, but why don't you just say "design" space and time," what's much more profound for us?
We understand your thoughts to understand it's not the same as their level of distracting.
As Einstein said, "Well, the things that can be as easy as possible -- but not easy."
You can tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with trade-making.
Some things are too much about finding, examples, stories and analogies, so you can put us into your mind.
And if you put your work, then let's take the numbers away.
Have you ever asked why it's called "The point of view?"
What happens when someone is thinking about it? Another one is going to be weeks, and with those numbers, your audience.
A slide like this isn't just boring, but also a lot of the conversation about the book-based part of our brain, and that's how we're more focused on it.
This example is that genes of Gene Bonysys is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the body is so stable that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, easy sentence that the audience can lose the thread, the spores, the images, the images that are also taking our other senses, and it creates a deeper deeper sense of understanding what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open up this door and see the miracleland that's really going to confront science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been taught to make the "The Grandpa in me" is a tight connection, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
If you look at your science and you're going to put your words and you're going to share this by the key, the audience is important, and multiply the whole thing with your incredible work: and it's made out of the things that you've got, and it's made that you know, it's a very simplable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really afraid of it.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can see a crime in the human race in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can start a message and a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get it in the soundboard and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1986, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and showed them.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're asking that all of these people who were born and asked change, a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phones up, keep them up!
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
These are many. Almost everyone has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and my phone, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines full of information.
We have raw data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.S. is a policy-based line.
The law is called the law of the law enforcement trade.
The law is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service service in Europe has to store a range of prostitutionies.
Who calls who? Who is sending a email?
Who is sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you're.
All of these information is stored for at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet license.
And everywhere in Europe, people are coming up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to fight these sovereign sanitation.
We want to control self-dimensionalism in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of these information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people were moving on the streets of Berlin and said, "Fatity instead of fear."
And some people said, well, this could be the Stye 2.0.
The mask is the Grandpholian in Eastbloodland.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can that really store all of these information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company who was the Nobel Prize, who was the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send me all the information that you've been wearing about.
And I asked her, and she said, "Well, she didn't get a right answer. Only a more rich blue.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's the same thing that you're doing.
So I decided to put a court of the war against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the Italian telecom said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was about a comparison with them.
I'm going to leave the tag to what they all demanded to send information.
Because in the meantime, the federal government decided that the introduction of the E.U. was the wrong response to German law enforcement.
So I got these ugly brown namps with a CD.
And on the CD, this was this.
35.830 lines on information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My hand is.
But then I realized that I was thinking about a while. That's my life.
These are six months of my life in this conference.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I'm sitting in, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to do them published.
Because I want to show people what's called the battlefield movement.
So with time online and open data City, I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankurt to the train of K<unk>car, and how many calls I'm going to go to the road.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm just calling my wife and she calls me, and we're talking to a few times.
And then I'm calling a few friends and they call each other.
And after a while, you call you, and you call them, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design that you can monitor a society, because you know who speaks to who you're sending a email, all of you can have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we've been wondering that all of these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, were in their pocket.
And the Stah had heard who was in the demonstration, and if the Stye had heard who the leaders were, maybe that's never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe the word that the Berlin wall would not have happened.
And then not the case of the heart of the curtain.
Because today, the government agencies and companies want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and online.
They want to track the possibility of tracking our lives, and they want to store all the time long.
But self-interest and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
They have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're just telling your prophet and the government's ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to the information that they've been carrying over you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight the self-dimensional state.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Conventional stores, rapid restaurants, Brack spaces.
So the city plan is to keep, and we thought, the name of South Central, so it's a different thing, it changed him in South Los Angeles, as if it changes something about what's going on in the city of the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Conpormies, rapid restaurants, refrigeration spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food city of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive and the Driveysys.
The fun is that the Drive-in-in-nut is killing more people than the Drensysys.
People die die in South Central Los Angeles in the unhealthy diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in Honly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even meet that anymore.
And I wondered how you feel if you had no access to healthy food, if you go out of the house, the negative effects that has on your neighborhood.
I'm going to think that carriers are buying and sold like automotive transport.
I see dialogue centers going down like Starbucks.
And I realized that this has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel a little bit about 45 minutes of aid to get a apple that's not equipped with pesticides in the periphery of the brain.
So I planted a food keyboard before my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park plant.
It's 45 feet up.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to do it.
So I think, "I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to hold it in."
And I decided to keep it in the state.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grords, and we started to plant my food, and fruit trees, so the whole program, the vegetables.
We're a kind of a set of labor group, we're surrounded by all the social layers and all over the city, and it's completely voluntary, and everything we're doing is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else complained.
The city came to me, and he basically gave me a contract of a station, and he said that I have to get my garden, the station was going to be a contract.
And I thought, "Well, come, right?
A leading deal on the food-making of food, on a piece of land that is completely different?"
And I thought, "Tool. Her hand."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about the city and talked to the city of Green Zero. They made a petition on Chau.org.org and 900 protagonators were successful.
We thought the victory was in the hands.
My town actually called it, and said that they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. There's the most gardening in the United States in the city.
They own 1,200 miles in the garage.
This is 20 Central Park.
That's enough surface to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell should they not find that OK?
By the plant of plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my bossy, and I'm telling people they should grow their own food.
And so that their own food is like printing their own money.
Look, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this unconcested reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
So gardenwork is my graffiti. I put my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who is shaking the walls, I'm going to make lawns and park plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my most vulnerable to this stuff.
They'd be surprised what the Earth can do when you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunblower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was to become a instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would wonder how to be influenced by how kids are affected by it.
The athletic is the most therapeutic and the most tough act that you can do, especially in the city.
And you get straws.
I remember this time when these mother and her daughter came out, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my garden, and I came out and they looked like this.
I felt really bad, because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason to the street."
I've been worried when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that's only what I've been forced to do. People said, "Fin, you're not afraid that you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "Well, "Sugah, no, I'm not afraid that they're going to be what they're going.
And it's also on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless garden in L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to put the cartets.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how they influenced them, and how they planted their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it changed for a moment.
Green Gres has planted about 20 gardens.
And we got to our way to our own, and we got 50 people and we did all of these volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, kids eat charcoal.
When they grow tomatoatoes, they eat tomatoatoes.
But if they're not offered by them if they're not shown how food and body, they eat blindly, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're sitting in this thing -- I see color-like kids who are right at the path that they're in the way that they're looking for, and that's not going to be anywhere.
The masks, I see as a chance of learning that we can train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could put the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole home block of gardens, where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipboard and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-poo, because free is not sustainable.
The fun of sustainability is that you have to keep it through it.
I'm talking to people, and we're going to get kids from the streets, and they're enjoying the joy of pride and honoring the honor of how to build their own food, and when you opened the farmer.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want to say that we're all about ecological forces, gang-class, gang-class-class.
We have to turn the picture of the ganglight.
If you're not a gardeny, you're not a gang.
You're going to get a little bit of a mug, you know?
And let's get the gun of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't tell me if you want to sit in your instincts and you want a meeting where you talk about some of them.
If you want to meet me, you come to your knees, in my garden so we can plant any of the wrinkles.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford in the world is "nnnnnhornic."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nnnollyol" means "nivient politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper officer was a better definition: "Anickner is someone who is a foreign, independent, or post-patching, or post-off, and his success is caused by the most dominant force of the dominant force of the aristocracy.
I have no idea what a piece of paper is.
Something else, I think, is a little bit.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers didn't get the exact word of the debance.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary names of Bratby, which was the case of the parliament.
They threw him in the tower of London, and they made him a little, but he was brave, he was too brave, he was finally getting so much support in London that he won't win.
And just a few years later, we find the first proxy for the sentence as Brass. Many people think.
Brut is a little bit more like the English word for a pist.
But that's not true. It's going to go back to a prisoner's license of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you to the United States at the time when they've just reached independence.
You looked at the question of how to call George Washington, the state of the state,
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader a legal nation?
It was a long-term conversation about Congress.
And there were all kinds of extra suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the governor Washington, and others, his high-furity George Washington, and again, the driver of the United States of America's Law.
Not that much more nuanced.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that's what it's going to be.
They were not monocististic, they wanted to choose the king for a particular period.
There could have been a work.
But everybody was bored with a little bit, because this conversation was three weeks old.
I read the days of a writer who is constantly writing, "I've got the same issue."
The reason for the failure was the most fun and the fun that the representation of the house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want to be that Washington is going to be a good job. They didn't want to.
King calls, and he may not even bring him to ideas.
They wanted to give him the most powerful, the most vulnerable title that they thought.
This is "The Talk.
President. They didn't invented the title. He didn't have happened. But he just meant someone who was wearing a board of a collection.
So that's how a failure of a jury is.
He had no longer size than the title "the Recessity" or "cater."
Sometimes, President-in-in-an-owned and government groups, but it was really a unfinished title.
And so the Senate refused to get it.
They said, "This is ridiculous, you can't call him a president.
This guy has to disclose and fight foreign police.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of America's United States?"
And then after three weeks, the Senate didn't come.
Instead, you're not going to have the word "The president" that is forced to use it, but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they were not supposed to be honest with their honest respect and civilized nations, whether or the Ministry of monarchy, where it's the state of the state of the state of the state of the state, which is the state of the state of the state of the state, that is not necessarily responsible for the rest of the president, and
You can learn three interesting things about this.
One, and I think that's the best -- until now I can't figure out if the Senate has ever been the title of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just the title of the name. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second thing you can learn is that if a government says something is temporary -- you're going to wait at 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States of America is not as difficult, right?
This has a little bit more than 5,000 nuclear wastes that he has and the largest economy in the world and a plugric drone and all this stuff.
And reality and story has given the title of size.
And so the Senate won the end.
They have a very respected title.
And the other concern of the war, the perfance of self-sood, is now.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear bombs and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate won, and the representative of the house lost, because nobody feels shocked when you're told you're the president of America's United States's U.S.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'll leave you with that.
Governments are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually change the reality much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a Laster with about 50 legislators to fight the Sharalabad -- a 40-year-old, vegetarian carpater from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to wake up my black piston with a pair of brown leather and a rocket in the process of the government that I couldn't see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I was raised with war, but next to Pyama party and football and singing with the rallyian Southeasts and Colombian protesters who live with the U.N. government and Afghanistan and the past-dested poetry, and the evidence that I knew that was what it was.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm a more suspicious Afghan, South nations of God Gnnese, a fundamentalist and a radical political artist who's been working in Afghanistan for the last nine years, and has created it.
So there's a lot of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rain-like paint music. I want to make the personality and stimulate authority and reporters and reporters and re-reuse the reality and even the way that we can use a kind of creative way of knowledge in the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- the one that he's doing with the terrorist to the community, like "Popel" and the armed religious and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can do as a jihad is to pay for the Parliament and make a choice campaign with the phrase "Take me! I'm a jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to let these Mabiosii who spend the national guys.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with the reason that we call "The Reach," where you're going to be a police, a false control center of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking money from the police, and instead of the police, and the police, in the name of the police, and the police, in Kabul, they're hoping that they're going to give us a few of us a million people.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the Middle East.
The war and the strange beliefs that came to him have created a new environment for the Roller and the fashion that you can only capture a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I'm in the local Afghan, with a remote-tested, a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a lot of a tracted, a pic, a pic, a mourpid-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in
And I would like to see how a simple rapper looks like from Kabul with the Kander of 189999 to create a dialogue about this, that today's development-state international international heritage has its roots in the past-datial tour, the "The Elephant of the man who has a brown man who has to protect himself and even to protect him a little more effective.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misaware.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self is necessary.
That's my driver. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and I've been working on as a model.
For 10 years, just mentioned.
I feel that now, there's a kind of a kind of awkward tension in the room, because I didn't have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I'm still going to change a little bit.
This is the first time someone is going to take a look at the TED stage, so you can appreciate happy to see this.
If some women were really excited when I came out, you don't need to tell me that I read later on Twitter.
I also think that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short seconds, which I think of.
And that's not the chance.
These distractions are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull the sweats over my head, because then you're all going to wake up, so you're not doing anything long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it wasn't that easy to do this picture.
A symbol is powerful, but a picture is also superfanged.
I've changed your mind in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I never had a friend in reality.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should call my back oil and my hand in the hair.
And besides surgery or the wrong grass, which I've been able to change for two days ago, there are very few ways of changing our fears, and our fears -- although it's superficial and irreducible -- is a huge impact on our lives.
It's a fear of being honest for me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a beautiful white woman, and I call this a sexy girl.
Now I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a very important legacy, and maybe you ask what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and aggressive and symmetrical, we are programmed by the confusion of ignorance, but also as big, feminine, feminine, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's an legacy that's given for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion-daughter calls, "Holomi. Naolon, Tyan. Joan Smink.
And first I'm talking about your model fiction. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious doctor of NYU has all been counted on the most possible mode, every single one that was taken, and that was made by 677 micromads, only less or less than four percent of them were not known.
The next question that I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
Do you know what? You can get everything.
You can become president's president, or the inventor of the next Internet or a Muslim-in-law, which would be completely wrong, because you're the first."
If they still say to this great, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Sor my boss."
Because I have no responsibility for nothing, and you could be the editor of American bird or the business leader of Hamp;MM, or the next Steven Meisel.
And I'm saying that you want to go to a model later, that's how you're going to win the Jackber prize in the nest.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to share with you 10 years of engineering, because unlike heart therapy, it can only be expanding.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice torder, and the driver says, "Tice, we want to run a picture in the run," now the tail is, and it's going to be nice and long, and long, this arm, back to the back, the head is moving down, and you're just moving back to the foot, and you're just going back to three hours of mine.
It looks like this.
Hopefully less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish the school and you've done a lot of jobs, you can't say much more. If you want to be president's president's country, but you're going to be a year-long neighborhood, "10,000 feet." You're going to look at weird.
The next question that I'm often asked to say is, "Who is all the photos going to be fired?"
And yes, so pretty much of all the photos are going to be crippled, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photo I've done, and that was the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months ago with my grandmother.
That's the day I'm this guy's song.
My friend had to get me.
I'm on a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a Shudget for French bird.
I'm with the football team and the V-A magazine.
And I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, from Hallylicists and machine scientists and photographers and Stylologists and all their assistant and the posts and the reporters. They're built. They're not.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "Well, did you do things free?"
Yes, I have too many 20 minutes of little cups I can never wear, except the things I get free are things I get to the real life and talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I was in a store, and I lost my money. And I gave myself the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was leaving a red light, and of course we were stopped. It was just a -- "Fear, Mr. Teszler, Mr. Teszler, and we could go on.
I have these costless things about my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who are talking about their appearance and not paying a high price.
I live in New York and I've been beaten by 140,000 teenagers who were beaten and beaten in the last year, 85 percent of black and Latino and most young men.
It's only 177,000 young men and black black and Latino, who is not the question, "Am I left?"
But, "How often do I leave? When I'm going to leave?"
And I found that I found that I was talking about 53 percent of all the women in the United States who don't like their body, and that number is up at 78 percent when they're introduced to 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit of thin and glowing hair, you feel very happy and great."
And we're going to give a answer to the answer that might be told by this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring, passionate, passionate people."
All right, but it's just half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, which I never said before is, "I feel confident."
And I feel confident because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask, "I'm happier when I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you'd get some parameters, because they've got the most thin legs and the most cool hair and the most coolestest littleest little, and they're the ones that are probably the most vulnerable women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to get a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to go here and say, "I got all the benefits of a stack that was forced to my hand." And it's not very good to me, and it's also very good for me, and it's not that's always going to make me happy. And that's not always happy.
It was very difficult to try to capture a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the largest payers.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've been here before 10 or 30 years old, and my career has been completely disrupted, because I would not tell my job, or maybe I wouldn't tell my first job, or maybe I would not tell me how I'm paid to be so much more, as I'm so much more, very good at college.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our unencession and misception.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in the exil, "Son, the Gafafiist Ari. He's got it.
But I'm never going to be as something like a Gafafi revolution."
It's now been nearly two years since the unololated revolution, inspired by the waves of mass mass destruction in both the Egyptian revolution.
I was connecting to many other nanans, within and outside, to challenge a day of anger, and to start a revolution against the tyranny regime.
And there she was, a great revolution.
Boy, Gayby women and men stood in the first row, the end of the regime, sent the Slogans of the freedom, dignity, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a very compelling courage to put them against the cruel dictator of Gafafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the near East to the south to the south.
Finally, after a period of months of brutal war and almost 50,000 deaths, we managed to liberate our country and reduce the tyranny.
But Gafi has left a great burden, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation of the course.
Over four decades, Gafafis has destroyed the natural regime of both infrastructure, including the culture and the moral structure of the gyian society.
The destruction and the challenges that I knew, I was going to change as many other women who are building the civil society, the Civilian Lyata, we asked a nonprofit and financial transition to democracy and nationalization.
Nortal organizations were formed during 200 countries and immediately after the case of Gafis in Benghaz, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exil, I came back to Lybia, and I started to organize some unique enthusiasm, I started to organize the context of the challenges of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace-in-an women, a movement of women, leadership, leadership, who is the goal of living in the sociination of women, and our right-being for the legal act of democracy and democracy.
I met a very difficult environment in the election, a environment that was more powerful to polarized, a environment that was defined by the selfish political politics of dominance and purpose.
I led a initiative to the peace platform to achieve a nonprofit choice, a law that would not be a law that should be a legal for any citizen to vote with the right, and to the political, to the political, with a female-in-in-in-in-in-in-level, and a female-in-level, and a broad-scale, and a more, to make a better-to-to-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-
At the end, our initiative was over and succeeded.
Women won 17, 175 percent of the nation's national war in the first elections since 52 years.
But very quickly, the euphemial minister of elections and the whole revolution, because every single day we were going to make new news about violence.
We went to the back of the year and we went to the back of the late-dood-daughter and Sufi guys.
On another morning, we got the message about the murderor of American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then again, another morning, the suicide bombers were sent to the army.
And really, every day we're going to be in the tyrant of the authorities and their ongoing concerns against the human being and their failures of rules and laws.
Our society, created by a revolutionary state, polarized and shattered from the ideals of the ideals and the freedom, dignity, social justice, the beginning they were at.
Strugability, mastery and ripping, the icon of the <unk>nolese era of revolution.
I'm not here to inspire you about the success of our defending attention and the elections.
In fact, I'm here to say that we've met as a nation who'd met false choice and the wrong choices.
We put our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace and stability or safety in Lybia.
Did the more appropriate and the change between female and female leaders and national reignation?
No, it didn't.
What is it?
Why will our society continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics and the defensation of the female and the women who are also born?
Maybe the women weren't the only ones that were missing, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the purpose.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a transformation of information as it needed to have the elections that has only supported the polarization and the fragmentation.
Our society needs the qualification of the female as the neural, the more powerful, the dominant posture of the female.
We have to stop the names of the anger and to ask a day of the ticker.
We have to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We have to develop a female comment, which is not only the following values, but also also to give it to the fact that Gice, instead of collaboration, instead of competition, rather than a strategy.
These are the ideals that a war-in-in-in-cested can be a peace-in-fat to achieve peace.
Because the peace has a alchemic, and in this case, the defending of the feminist and the butterbormic view.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do that, before we do it, we do it with sociological stereotypes.
After a lie from the Koran "Salamam" -- "I'm talking about the word of the most good God, haw, haw.
The word "raver" again, which is known in all of our distant philosophy, has the same Arabic root as "The Purwn" and symbolized the birth of the country, the whole human being, the female and the female and the female of the most vulnerable and the peoples.
And just like the mother's head, which grows in him, completely changed the basic rest of compassion.
And so I said, "My Goube is all about it."
And so I said, "My Gnade has been a preconce of my frant."
And we're all going to be the kind of space of the world.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the song "The final."
And I was very proud.
In school, we're going to take the story of Kim Il, but we didn't learn a lot about the world, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I was often wondering how the world's world is, I thought I would spend my life in North Korea until a whole change of everything.
And I saw a public approach at seven years, but I thought my life in North Korea is normal.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to suffer hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a colleague, from the sister of a colleague.
And she said, "If you're going to be our five family members in this world, because we've been eating nothing anymore for two weeks.
We're in the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people were dying in my country.
Shortly, I went back to the station, and I saw something terrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A rainy woman was on the ground, and a broken child in her arm was shaking into his arm, in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were all so busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-170s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were blind to the victims, and many others survived because they ate grass, the beetle, the beetle and the tree and the sealine.
The amount of electricity is increasingly more and more likely to be so much more and less than the lights of China on the other side of the world that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors in night.
This is the river of the Ibores, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very clear, and it allows North Central Boranters to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the river.
I can't tell a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the wounded years of the famine to the tropical relatives to China.
I just thought that I would be separated by my family for a short time.
I never thought it's needed to work for 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be as Northeast refugees, but soon I learned that it's not just very difficult, but also very dangerous. Because North Central refugees in China are seen as illegal immigrant.
So I lived in a more unequal fear that my real identity could fly down, and you would send me back into a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was beaten by the Chinese police and sent the police to the police department.
Somebody told me that Northanine, so they tested my Chinese records, and asked me a lot of questions.
I was afraid of that, I thought, my heart would explode.
If you're not going to be a little bit more altruistic, I could be beaten and I could be rejected.
I thought that's the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they were ready to do the questions, a lawyer said to the other, "This was a false deal.
She's not a Northan lady."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some Northeastans in China, in the foreign messages of the foreign messages, but many of them are taken by the Chinese police.
These girls had great happiness.
Although they got caught, they finally released the massive international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much fortune.
Every year, many North Koreans are caught in China and they are arrested to North Korea, where they're rebuilt, they're being rebuilt, they're being rebuilt or publicly trained.
Although I was lucky to escape my own independence, there's no lot of South Koreans.
It's tragic that Northanans have to hide their identity and fight hard to survive.
After the time they learned a new language, and they found work, their world can be launched at a moment.
After 10 years of the failure, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was leaving a bigger challenge in South Korea, and I thought it was a bigger challenge.
English was so important in South Korea, that I had to start learning my third language.
And I also influenced the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we're very close to a very narrow, because of 67 years, we're part of the part of the project.
I was doing a identity crisis.
Am I South or Northananan?
Where am I coming from? Who am I?
Suddenly, no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't realize the connection to the Southwest life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording of the university.
Just when I became a new life, I got a proud call.
The North Bronx administration started sending the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to be a remote place on the country.
They had to be able to fly as quickly as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to leave an incredible route to the freedom of the way.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself on the northwest border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to fight them, over over 2,000 miles through China, and then to Southeast Asia.
The bus ship took a week, and we almost lost a few times.
Once a time the bus was beaten, a Chinese police police officer came into.
He took the idea of all of all, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese officer told my family, I was determined, and he said she was a roint, and I was her to the vic.
He looked at me, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to go to the bottom, but I had to make almost all of my money to the border of Lijuana's Law.
But even after we've been covering the border, my family was replicated because of illegal border.
After having paid money and paid a lot of money, my family was released within a month, but shortly, my family was replicated in the capital of Lijuana.
That was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to defuse my family to the freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the Southwest message.
I went to the Department of the United Nations and the police department, trying to get my family, but I had no enough money to pay money and money.
I lost all of my hope.
And then I asked the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is concerned about it.
In a broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and I didn't want to put a bank, and I paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I told him about my own heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I'm not helping you," he answered.
"I'm helping the Northwest people."
And I realized that this was a symbol of a reality in my life.
The previous stranger who had been symbolized me as a new hope that the Northanans needed so much, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope to need the Northanans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I grew up in South Korea, but the freedom of the freedom is just a step.
Many Northeastans are separated by their families, and once they get into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us to learn education, the English learning education, the workforce and many more.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of the world, because many of us remain in contact with families, and we send them information and money and money to change North Korea from the inside.
I had so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to resist the most hopeful North Bronx to success with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot of successful North Koreans all over the world, but also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just got a request today.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Now I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk about it, but he's communicating joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He's connecting them to it, and he's putting them in a way that they're not defending.
He's not a little bit. He doesn't care about the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and she's just saying, "He's never told a lie.
When he was listening to the songs of our childhood, when he tries to think about words that I never remember, he reminds me of something: how little we know about the minds and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has a absolutely unhealthy memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he's wearing my chocolate hair-law, but he remembers the previous year of every song on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four of the first result of the teubpet on my armet and the king of the birthday.
Don't you hear it incredibly amazing?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit in the social version of normal, they're often understood and wrong.
But what my heart encouraged and my soul was that although that was the case that they were not considered as popular, that was only one: they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not as familiar with the term "the Physism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that influenced the social communication and sometimes the physical abilities.
It's a different thing that's happening in any individual, and it's called Remi, like Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes, when there's a new person who's often diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing-growing interventions in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm sitting in autism, but I can't remember it without any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized he was different.
He was very much.
He didn't want to play the same babies, and actually he didn't think he was very interested in me.
Remi lived and reacted in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like cars to put cars into a row of space, and eating everything that came under the machine and eating everything that came under.
And when he got older, he became different, and the differences became visible.
But behind the anger and the razard, and the one who was never going to be the most unregular activity, a completely awkward and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any doubting, a human who had never been.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of mine that I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they taught me about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
So normality is about the beauty that we give us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It's just that there's another kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to say about Remi, and to you, it would be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or non-religistic, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody has a gift in itself, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is going to die in the moment that we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Ed McNon has been engaged with curiosity and curiosity, with this photograph, with a little apple, and with a mass of waste, only a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
Let me introduce you a new kind of photography that can make the Femto photographer, a new engineering technology that's so fast that they can make time-time images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that can look at the outside of our perspective or see a <unk>-ray in our body and really ask what we call "Lake."
Now, if I take a laser, and I put it into a billionth-by-century -- these are several fans, I create a piece of photons that's hardly a millimeter, and that's hardly a vertical, and this is a project, this project, it's going to move into light, and it's going to be able to move into light, and it's like a million times faster than a year.
So if you take this project, this photons of paper, and you put it into this bottle, how will these photons break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event.
So think about this, you know, the whole event is actually less than a nanot, so long as the light takes to get back to this route -- but I'm going to try to get the quick thing to the factor of 10 billion dollars so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola has not funded this research.
So in this movie, a lot of things happened, so let me analyze this and show you what's happening.
The pulse, our project, is turning into the bottle of a photons, which starts to move through the direction, and then the result is flowing inside.
One of the light is flowing down to the table, and you see that spread of waves.
Many of the photons are ultimately going to reach the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that's going to be around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are focused on the table, and because of the reflection of the top of the screen, the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now if you take a common project and you leave it back and slow it back the same route back to the factor of 10 billion, you know, how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little bit of silence photography?
You can see again how these waves of the table, the Toml and the wall is swimming over the background.
It's when you put a stone in a pond.
And I was like to paint the nature of this picture, every single-to-section, but of course our eye is a set of a series of images.
But if you look at these Tom's Day, you'll notice that when the light hits the light, the lights are going to be over, the further it is going to be dark.
Why is that? Because Tom's coming down and the light goes around in your way and come back to a few billionth of a second.
So in the future, if these Femto-M-M-M-M-Mowy is built in your camera, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find if a fruit is a fruit, no one's a fruit, no one, no one's a while to touch them.
So how did my team do this camera do?
So as a photographer, you know, when you do a photograph with short-term waste, you have very little light, but we can make a billion times faster than your shortest expansion, so you get the same light as well.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons, a million times, and we're taking it back with very clever processing, and we're going to combine these terabytes of data to make these FauT's videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data, and we can do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future supercomputer: can see parts?
The idea is that we're going to put a little bit of light on the door.
It's going to go down into the room, and it's part of it, and it's going to be reflected back to the door, and eventually we could use these more extracting light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femto's camera.
The wall is hidden in the wall, and we'll let the light go down to the door.
After our paper was published in the "The Nationalce Healthications", it was released by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light project, and they're going to be able to put it on this wall, and this photons are going to be fooled, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will break the light, and then then then the door will reflect a part of the light, and then a tiny bit of light of the light, and then the tiny bit of the photons will come back to the surface, but they'll be closer
And because we have a camera that is so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time-effective, and it can look at the world at light speed.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is to the distance.
By taking a laser, we can take a little bit of a raw image that you see -- how you see on the screen -- but not really makes sense, but if we take many of these images, dozens of these images, and they try to analyze the different light-touch, then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering.
We've got a lot of things to do before we can actually put this into the design of the lab, we could use cars that are protecting and recognize what's behind the curve, or we can look at in dangerous weapons, by looking at the light, by moving through the window, or the end of the wing, or the end, we can build the skin in deep, and so on the body, and so on the body, and so forth.
But because of the pel and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, why this is really a game call for scientists, now, about Femto-Miking photography, because a new visualization process, actually, the next generation of medical representation could solve.
So, like Docon, even a scientist, even a scientist, is a art of the ultra-dimensional photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we're using is not just the scientific image. We can create a new paradigm of the computer of the photoconomy, and we can only take a new sculpture with the light, and we can't look at all of these waves, and we can look at all of those waves.
But it's also something fun about this.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move us to us.
What's happening here?
It turns out that we've been able to take almost light, weird effects, and Einstein would have heard this picture incredibly.
The order that happens in the world, in terms of events, is that in a rapid order, so by using the relationship of space and time, we can correct these biases.
So no matter how to focus on photography and allow us to understand a new visualization for medicine or new interfaces since our invention, we've been able to completely open the data and hope that the world's the heroic and the creative community, the creative and the creative community, that we should tell us that we should start to start to start to capture the next-to-screen perspective, and we should begin to begin to begin to capture the next-t quickly-up perspective.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street so many arguments are not going to be passed, but we use the same public places.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors, and I tried to use things like a pair of spirts, acod and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much payers my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without keeping ourselves?
How can we share our memories on the limits of the buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities are shaping our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is driven by the huge, which has been harassed for hundreds of years, hiring and caterpic shadows. I trust a city where music is always.
I think every time anyone never ever ever miss, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the most of the neighborhoods in America.
I live in the room near, and I thought about how I can make it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in in in life today.
But I'm really hard to keep this view of day.
It's easy to lose your life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a side of the house into a giant box, and I wrote a bunch of spimus of the gaps: "I want to die!" I want to take a piece of chalk, a piece of blood, thinking about his life and his hopes to share his lives in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do in the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely filled, and she grew.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people who were written in the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be harassed by piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to stand on a broad-time over the International Recessation."
"I'm going to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm going to die, I want to live in the web."
"I'm going to die, I'll keep them in my poor."
"I'm going to die, I'd like to be somebody's Kavillic."
"I'm going to die, I'm going to be myself."
This is a place that was neglected to a meaningful place, and the hopes of the people and the dreams of the people brought me to laugh, to the wine and the hardest times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's a new and more inclusive way.
It's about creating space for thinking and thinking about what's most important to us while we grow and change.
I've done this last year, and I've gotten hundreds of the messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've created a buildingbox, and now in the world of Kazan, Southeast, Australia, Argentina, Argentina, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public places when we have the opportunity to focus our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever to look at things with the right view, and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often complaining about death or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the effort of death is one of the things that's most strengthed to us.
The idea of death is that we can make life.
Our common places are best to show us what we are as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, fears and stories, can't help us to help us to create better places, to help us live better places, to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm interested with a very, very special math. I'm interested in any problem that is that we're like a business worker.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain today about what I'm doing.
Teaching is one of the most powerful activities.
We're excited about the most aggressive ballettett and the ropes, as you're going to see.
The engine is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and maybe the fundamental evidence that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slow down the extraordinary capacity. It also does it with my Hungarian Kacriv, which was a ballet of a ballet.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer in this disease, and they have to live with the unhealthy symptoms like weakness, caterility, cissility, and others who are doing that disease, so we need objective, to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progressability objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there's a cure when we have a objective measure that can answer this question.
In trouble, there's no biomark that there's no biomarkal activity, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies will never be done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a pre-exventional tour in the hospital. What if patients could make this test?
It wouldn't require a labor-to-driving hospital.
It costs 300 percent to actually study the neurological field.
So I want to suggest to you a non-profit method that we're trying to achieve this, because we're all in a sense, virtual, virtual, like my Athensan Chacval.
Here's a video of the vibrant muscles.
This is happening in a healthy condition, if someone sends speech sounds, we can look at the legitimate balletic dancer, because we need to coordinate all these receptures, if we make the sound, and we have all the genes for Fox2, for example.
And as ballet is required a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to talk to it until it's learning.
And by contrast, we can determine the position of the sensitive muscles, and as the limb is also affected by the muscle of Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom line, you can see an example of irregular vocal expressions.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
It's uncomfortable, shame, cissility.
The language is even too quiet and cold, and that's an example of a curator.
And this impacts can be more and more likely to be more, but with digital microphones and predicting software, combined with new machine learning, which is now very advanced, so we can see where somebody is in a pubax between the disease and health and the disease, just because of the mood of the mood.
How can these tests measure with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-revasive. The test with neurologists.
It's not a little bit. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are accurate. That's why the models are not done by experts.
So you can do it yourself.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely cheap is, you can also use it in a large scale.
Now, this amazing goals can be done with this.
We can reduce rational difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to do a routine control in the hospital.
We can achieve objective data through the more dramatic observation.
We can do low-cost mass training for clinical trials, and first of all the population is going to be accessible.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's disease.
With Averab and patient's Days Day, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough seed data, to the more effective goals.
We have a reputation number that is accessible to a billion people on this planet.
Everyone who can do with no or no Parkinson's disease can call cheaply to leave pictures for a few cents. I'm talking to joy that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of samples, we say 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to argue while the doctor is to attack whether that person is suffering to Parkinson's Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you may not be able to get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, especially what's interesting. These conditions are important, because we're in order to figure out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's Parkinson's disease.
At the time, they have 86 percent accuracy.
It's much better.
My students Thisis -- I have to make it, because he's done this fantastic work -- now showed that it's working on the cell phone network, which allows us to do this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
That means that people can call -- people can call the phone and they could call the test with Parkinson's disease, they could send their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Max Led, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and that's behind the kitchen, the Baltimore National Park.
The Baltimore National Park is just a little bit of a little bit of a sudden, and that means that wildlife birds can rely on the park at the time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who died at night. I woke up in the morning, and she found dead. It was terrible. It was our only snail.
My tribe, the tribe of the Maai, believe that we came together with our animals and the Lathland of heaven, so our animals are so much.
As a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our warrior's name of Morans. They protect our stem and our relatives. They're also in charge of this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions who were killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park is just as few lions.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years of his father's sons, and that's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this would not really help us, but the lions are helping to see the cows better.
But I didn't go on. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to shoot it with a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to go next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird's records and you go back. But the next time they come, and they come, the thing is not going to move, it's still here.
And they're going to reach out and kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the Stall. I went around a tap in the hand and I broke it around, and that's the lions didn't get to the lion.
lions are afraid of light, which is moving.
I had an idea.
And I was working on the room for a little boy, and I even took the new radio apart my mother, and the day she made me almost a lot. But I had learned about electronics.
I took a old car battery and a driver of a motor plant. It shows if you want to turn your right or left. It's cool.
And I've been making a switch to turn the lights and turn it into.
This is a little snack from a broken bag.
And then I built all of these together.
The solar canpower the battery, the battery is producing electricity to the right-source. I call it a transpator.
And the driver is shaking.
You can see that the drop of the leaves are coming out, because of course the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are shining, and the lions believe that I'm going to go around the cliffs, and I was all the time in bed.
Thank you.
I've been running this in our homes, and since we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She lost a lot of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really working well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, but also for other predators like hyks or leopard seals, the lights also serve to keep elephants from rivers.
My invention was given to me a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brook Street School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved, and it helps with the donations and the education.
I even put my friends home, and we put the lights there, where there's no one, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
A year ago, I only got a boy from the savanna who was shaking his father's cows. I saw airplanes about me and said, "Ean's day I'm sitting in a box!"
And here I'm here.
I was given to a plane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to become a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to resist lions. But I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can cooperate in common side with the lions, without arguments.
Ash<unk><unk><unk><unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your own.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list?
My next invention, now I work on a electrical fence. A prosthetic trick?
Yes, I know electrical color is invented long, but I want to have my own.
You've been trying to do it, not true -- yes, I've been trying to get the trial back, because I got a break.
It's hard. Richard Turder, you're special.
We're going to hire you to each step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old, a camera in your hand is photography. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images; and I didn't have the only one of them.
There was no kind of director, no style, no longer to take a picture. Not even the lighting was taken.
And to be honest, most of them were shot from previous tours.
My story begins when I was a talk to New York, and my wife made this picture that I put my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and five.
We were in New York, and we were finally able to take the same picture back to the same picture.
Well, you can see where this is going from --
When my third birthday told me, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina, and they're going to make a father-in-the-old funeral, to continue to continue the ritual?"
And we started asking the past of the day to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal gesture is when you're going to be a completely stranger to his camera.
Nobody said no one, and fortunately, nobody is still sitting with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a pre-cested moment, or a certain journey.
They are also a way of a week to keep the time in October and how we change our time and how we change from year to year, not just physically physically physically, but in everything.
Because although we do the same image, our perspective of time is changing, while they're getting more and new miles, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything and how they see it.
And this very intense time that we spend with each other is something we expect and expect every year.
In fact, as one of our travel, we went back and suddenly they're going to be like the most assault, it's shown on a red bar on a little bit of a toy, which they learned as a little child at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she had been as a five-year-old at that point.
She said she remembers her heart of his chest when she saw nine years ago the store for the first time.
And now she looks at them in New York to high school because she's really going to study in New York.
And I was struck by this: The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in the mind of memories.
I don't know how it looks like you, but besides those 15 images, I'm pretty much of a family photograph.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
I want to encourage you to come to the image of today and ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 22.82, 53.3/29.6/17.8/10.9 (BP=0.969, ration=0.970)
