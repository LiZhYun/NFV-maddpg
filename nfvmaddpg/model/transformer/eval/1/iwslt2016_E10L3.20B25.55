When I was 11 years old, I was fired by the sounds of a day.
My father heard on his little, gray radio show at the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was rather unusual at the time, because the news was often depressing.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my father, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban were taking the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were forbidden to go to school.
And so I was committing for five years when I was a boy and I was advising my older sister who didn't have to go alone, to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school both.
We took another way every day so that nobody could guess where we went.
We're sitting in our books in shopping bags so it looks like we're just going to buy.
We were doing it in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was kind of a nasty thing in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then again, the class suddenly had to be out for a week because the Taliban had signed up.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to leave us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was critical and my daughters were valued.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign man from a nearby province of Afghanistan. He insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
My mother was a trained mother.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to convert our house to school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here's -- was the first person in his family who'd ever received an education.
And it was always clear that his kids would have been given education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk to send his kids not to school.
I know, I know, in the years, that I was frustrated under the Taliban, sometimes I was so frustrated by our lives, by the perpetual fear and the interruption.
I was having good fun giving up. But my father said, "Excuse me, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be displaced by your house in war.
But one thing is, you're going to stay alone: what's inside here, and even if we have to pay your blood to your school, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades by war.
Less than six percent of my older women have a higher degree of college education, and if my family hadn't been so much used for my education, I would be one of those women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, when I was a proudly Jew at the Harlembury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, was because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first ones who shared me.
He's not just talking to my graduate degree, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the one who drives him through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more common dreams for me.
That's why I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women education.
And so I've been able to build SOLA, the first and perhaps only board for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students at school want to be aware of the most ambitious potential for all of them.
And seeing her parents and fathers standing for her, as my parents at the time, despite the abruptity of all the time.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they were killed by a bomb on the street only for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rings, and a voice beat him, if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try it again.
He said, "Take me now if you want to, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your old and over-expived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've discovered something that is often left in the West: behind most of us who have succeeded, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that's that their success is also its success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not going to be a very important role in our success.
They're often the ones that are often re-evalable and compelling for the hope of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is unconnected.
And under the Taliban, there were only a few hundred girls going to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the lunch bank.
Afghanistan appears to look at America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that changes are not long-term, and they're changing with the sovereign groups.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and her parents who are using them for them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me, for me, a country of hope and the unlimited opportunity, and remember, every day, the girls, going to SOLA.
Just like I have a big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including a living -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977, I'm young, but I'm not -- -- -- -- in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia working on the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I think 21 years, we thought we're Italian good people and we've made good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples at Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the Islamic people of Sambias to be building food.
We came to Italian seed seeds in South Africa; in this glowing valley, which leads to Sammeni River, and we taught the local population to grow the Italian tomato and tobini and ...
Of course, the local had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they began to come up.
We were amazed that there was no such fertile coal in such a crop.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God for us to be here!"
"Sallally time to save people from the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this gorgeous tomato tomato tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how simple agriculture is."
When the tomato boomers were red and red, over night, there were about 200 pilps coming out of the river and yelling everything.
We said to the Guambers, "Oh my God, the Filles!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have farming here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were Italian-doughy in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what did the English world, what did the French, and after seeing what they did, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the candle.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense we've given the unconventional African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a peer-American scientist.
The book was published in 2009.
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been doing.
Just read your book.
Check out of an African, which we've been doing.
We are Western people, colonialists, ambcticists, missionaries, and there are only two ways that we deal with people, we colonize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I train every other culture, as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I train every other culture, as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bure," the boss, the CEO.
I was delighted when I read the book "Sall Beautiful" by laughter. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, then let them stay alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, Mr. Mr. Teszler opened this conference, a pole on the floor, and he said, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocolatial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people and invented a system called business promotion, never, never will someone be motivated, but you're going to be the local passionary of local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community of ideas, you put them together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafeteria. We meet in kitchipe.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing about humanity.
We're helping them find knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
I've had this case for many years, why instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have a part, and they will never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunity.
Design has this light spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never seem to be public meetings.
We work one to one to do that, to do it, has to be created by a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new profession has to be created.
This is the hospital physician, the hospital of the business worker who sits with you in the house with your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the tools to transform your passion in a way that you want to bring life to life.
I've tried this in Esperance, West Australia, trying to do it.
I was advising at the time, trying to break the crushing disbelief, where we're going to say what to do.
And so I walked through the streets for the first year and I had my first three days, and I helped him. He helped him build fish in a garage, he helped him sell to a restaurant in Perth, and then we got to organize, and then the fishermen and they said, "You've helped Maor? Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers, and I didn't have this wonderful tuna in Albany, to sell it to 60 cents, but to Japan for Sushi, for 15 dollars. Then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped help them help us help. Can you help us help us?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How are you doing this?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I hear them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Let's get it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the process of building.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be on loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was involved with business. Peter's printer said, planning is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics.
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch, you don't know what the smartest human Christchurch is trying to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get you to one.
You have to provide them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they'll come up with them.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the most cheeks you've ever liked for today tomorrow?
<unk>uite loving, passionate people. You hated this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to do it.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- the precursor to fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal engine is not sustainable.
The open-life realm is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, heal, build, transport, share with them.
Technology doesn't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget.
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of New York City in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and they were sampling, which would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was a preconcession: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grow up in that pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get their hands, and it would be impossible to get the dung of six million horses.
Because they were already lying in the dung.
Thirty60s, they see the dirty technology that lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the U.S. -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology has made a race. There were tiny little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered to be disclosion.
They don't come and talk to you.
The next thing you have to offer them absolute, committed and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of them have to be able to perform, three things: to sell that market, to be great, to be the market market market market, and be massive.
Do you think?
We've never met one person who can produce something at the same time, sell and get paid for money.
That's not what it doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 idiest companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wicehouse, Edison, Ford, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have all of our successful companies, only one: no one is founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 years of entrepreneurs in North Carolina, and we start giving them the lectures to give them the first two pages of Richard Bransons's Monographs, and the job of the 16 years, to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons Monographography, as often as he uses the word "I am," and often the word "we" as "we"
Never "I am," and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small professional background in cafeteria and Bars and their dedicated buddy who's done for them, what someone here has done for this gentleman talking about this epos. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Would you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support companies to help them find the tools and the people. We found out that the wonders of the public intelligence can be transformed by the culture and the economy of this community, just by understanding the passion and the ability of human imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be at Alice's miracles.
So Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communication -- to share training education in communication.
I was scared.
Fear. Fear from those students with their large brains and their large books and their big books, don't trust me.
But when the conversation started, he took me like Alice, when she pulled down to the pig and saw a door to a new world.
I was just like, when I was talking to students, I was amazed by the idea they had, and I wanted to find that other people discovered this miracle country.
I think to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We really need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones we're facing our biggest problems, like energy and environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, then it's not going to go forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a scientist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
I want to show you a couple of ways of how you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're looking at, is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well, right?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only do you think of your grandchildren, but also tell us that their cheeks, the little structure in our bones, are examined in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat osterosor.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not talking about any kind of stuff.
Unconcords are a barrier to understanding your thoughts.
I'm sure you could use "talk" and time" in your own, but why don't you just tell me "a-space and time," what is much more comfortable for us?
And to make your mind understand, it's not the same as they're going to drop down.
As Einstein said, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific field without having to deal with compromise.
So a couple of things are about looking at: examples, stories and analogies. In this way, you can pull us into your hacking.
And if you're presented to your work, then you're going to take off the dots.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "dide point?"
What happens when someone comes to mind? Another one is about to take a while, and with those dots, you know, your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it's also very boring to the talk-making part of our brain, and by doing so, we're very quickly challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the spine is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, simple puncture sentence where the audience can lose the thread, act on the screen, and then reuse images and graphs that also inform our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what you're describing.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open up the door and see the wonder country that celebrates science and technology.
Because the engineers I've taught, I've taught myself to connect with the "Nerdar in me" -- I want to summarize everything with a equation.
Look at your science and your preconceptions and your preconceptions, share these by the goodness, so the audience says what's important, and multiply the passion that you have for your incredible work: and it comes from creating some kind of un-undalleable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really excited.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can see a currency with a cell phone. You can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can write a message with a cell phone, and you start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a phone phone, you can take a song, you can upload it on sound cloud, you'll be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984, and I live in Berlin.
So let's go back to this city at that time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people go to the street and demonstrate how to change the street.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're wondering that all of these people who were coming across and asking changes, had a cell phone in the bag.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. A Android, an Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, my cell phone wants to talk about me and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 points of information.
We have raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Recession has set up a policy line.
This is a rule of law-based trade-off.
This is a rule that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in Europe has to store a range of users.
Who calls who? Who's sending an email?
Who is sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone, where you're.
All this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are all up there, and they said, "We don't want that."
They said we don't want to have this protection protection protection protection.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, priests, all of whom said, "We don't want that."
And you can see tens of thousands of people marching up on the streets of Berlin and say, "Srangeness instead of fear."
And some of them even said this could be a be an amya 2.0.
The mask was the head-impoth police in the east border.
And I'm also wondering if this really works.
Can all of this information really store about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the German telecom business, which was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, send all the information you've been carrying over me.
And I asked her once and asked her again and she didn't get a right answer. Only a more blue.
But then I told myself I want to have this information because it's my life that's updated.
So I decided to put a court trial against it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going to take back the bill, which they're all asking me to send information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court officer decided the introduction of the E.U. Conclording Act was a German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830s of data on information.
First, I saw it and I said, well, it's a huge file. My back.
But then I realized, after a while, that's my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what should I do with this?
Because you see where I'm where I'm asleep, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what's called a protective security trade.
So with time online and open data city, I've done this.
This is an visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and forth.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to Kumble, and how many calls I'm going to go.
All of this is possible by this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, it's just like, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then a couple of friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call them up, and we have this huge network of communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where times they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction map for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who speaks to who to who to send an email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said, we're thinking about all these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, phones in their pocket.
And the St.C. would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the St.C. had known to have been the leader, it would never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe it wouldn't happen.
And then, not the case of the Ice curtain.
Because today, national agency and companies want to store so many information, as they can get over us, online and legitimate.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your opponents, just because companies and government places have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your self-level self-level self-level self-level self-level.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Immedate stores, rapid restaurants, Brack.
So the city map is meeting and they thought, "Well, if we change the name of South Central, so it's true for something else, they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Immedated stores, rapid restaurants, refrigerators, real spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drivehrus and the Drivebys.
The cometic is that the Drivehrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in impairable diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it's in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't meet that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of your house, the negative impact that has the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I dream that we buy slaps and sold them like use vehicles.
I see a conversation-class walking around like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what it's going to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
I didn't have any fun time to get a apple, but I didn't have a clue to 45 minutes.
So I planted a food rocket in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call park plant.
It's 45 feet at four feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to be engaged.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility and I have to stay in."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grills, together, and we started planting my food heat and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of professional group, composed of hulls from all the social layers and all the city, it's completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically raised me on a station, and said I have to get rid of my garden, the station was a secret to a leader.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A popular set of instructions for growing food from a piece of land that you're totally comfortable with?
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand with it."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times received wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it and talked to the city board and a member of Green Ground Zero. They made a petition on the front of the board.org and 900 signatures, we were successful.
We thought we were in the head of the head.
My city even called it, and said they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most garden in the United States in the city.
They have 67 miles in Brack.
This is 20 Central parks.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell should they not find that right?
And by building a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my life mobilization, I'm telling people to grow their own food.
To grow their own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have an legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more happy to be part of this preconceived reality made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Working is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's hiking the walls, I'm going to get lawns and park facilities.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my graves for this stuff.
You would be surprised by what the ground does when you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden to become an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
You would be wondering how kids are influenced by it.
The garden is the therapeutic and most bold act you can do, especially in the city.
And you get strawberry.
I remember this time, when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 o'clock in night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason to go on the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and it only empowered me to do this. People asked me, "Fin, don't worry that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Give God, no, I don't fear it, you know.
And it's on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
And then, one day, I put a garden in this homeless garden in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the planner.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it has changed, even if it's just for a moment.
Green Grills have already planted 20 gardens for about 20 gardenes.
And we got 50 people in our way, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow, children eat charcoal.
When they grow tomato, they eat tomato sauce.
But if they don't get any of them, if they're not shown how they're not able to show how food and body affects, they're blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they sit in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that are just for them, and that's not going to lead to anywhere.
I'm a residential experience as an opportunity to train these kids to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole residential block of gardens, where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipboard container and convert it into a healthy cafe.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free stop, because free is not sustainable.
The fun of sustainability is you have to keep them through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and they're enjoying the joy and the honor of being able to build their own food, and when you open farmers' markets.
So, what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want you to become all environmental rebels, gangsters, gang gardeners.
We have to turn the picture of the valleys.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to be a kid-and-shack, right?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you sit in the box chairs and you want to make a meeting where you're talking about making some laughs.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skirt, you get in my backyard so that we can plant any shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford dictionary is "nnnolly monaster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snnolly monaster" means "for-articulate politicians."
Although a newspaper publisher was given a better definition in the 19th century: "A Snollygoster is someone who is pre-elected by a foreign, independent of party, program, program, program, and his success is going to be able to achieve the pure force of the monumental hypothetical.
I have no idea what a paper is.
Something about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
For example, 177, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers didn't have the exact word of the debug.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was looking at Parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London and they gave him a man, but he was courageous enough, he was brave enough to fight, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first sign for the sentence "soy" as Brass." Many people think.
Brass is a word for the English word for the pist.
But that's not true. It goes back to a liberation of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time when they've reached independence.
You'd look at the question of how to call George Washington, the head of the head.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Dutch nation?
It was a conversation about this in Congress for almost a long time.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Govern Washington, and others, his highness of George Washington, and again, the banination of the freedom of the people in the United States of America.
Not such a thing.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was preventable.
They were not monarchical, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with bored, because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the journal of a funeral book that always wrote, "I've been thinking about the same topic."
The reason for the waist and the boredom was that the representment house was against the Senate.
The representative househouse didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want to.
King calls, and maybe even gives him ideas to follow.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most daunting title, the most obvious title that they thought of.
This title was "The Guildor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He happened before. But he only meant someone to be harassed by a gathering.
Something like the pre-secution of a jury.
He had no longer the size of the record, or "Dear water."
Sometimes, president had small colonial parties and government groups, but it was a very unmanned title.
That's why the Senate refused to leave him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign the agreement and hit foreign feathers.
Who's going to take him seriously when he's got a silly title as president of America's United States?
And then after three weeks, the Senate didn't come to the Senate.
Instead, you'd have a sense of the idea of using the "The Prince" as the "duty" as "discovery," but they would be absolutely clear that they didn't want to be honest about their own honest respect for the opinions and civilized nations, whether it's in the Republic of the state, that the president didn't commit to the president and the United Nations's administration.
You can learn three interesting things.
First, and I think that's the best thing -- until now I can't figure out if the Senate ever confirmed the title of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, she was just awarding the title. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something is temporary -- -- -- you're waiting at 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is, "The prime minister of America today is not so humorous, isn't it?
That has to do with something more than 5,000 nuclear cricket that it has and the largest economy in the world and a flairment and all this stuff.
and reality has given the title of the size.
And so the Senate won the end.
They have a respectional title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the sound of self-destruction -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have an president?
147, 147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear bombheads and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house won, because nobody feels shocked when you're told that you're the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rebellion in the fight for Moalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to wake up my black concerts against a pair of brown leather-and-white, and I'm going to put a rocket on the government's headside that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I'd been big with war, but I've been singing alongside Pyjama parties and football friends and singing at Sam's and singing with racist countries and inconsistent by non-religist demonstrations that never lived with communism and lived for Afghanistan and re-cading and exploring and exploring what I knew before that meant.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, a more, more inspired Afghans, South nations of God Ghrhrades. An atheist and a radical political artist who has been working for the last nine years in Afghanistan, and created.
So, there are lots of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like painting rainglows. I want art to be confused by the personality and re-focusing and re-introducing the reality and even using a kind of imaginative people to try to understand the world we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- a night, a terrorist fight against the criminalist, like "Popar" and use armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihadiest number when they're going to run for Parliament and do a choice campaign with the slogan: "Take me! I'm making jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to let these mafiosi have been able to let them do as a national hero.
I want to go to the bottom of the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "reach," where you're a police station, a false control station on the streets of Kabul, but instead of taking cars and giving them money to the police department in Kabul and giving them money to the police department, and they hope to give them 100 percent of them to attack.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become, I think, as a fashion conflict.
The war and the strange views that came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture using a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine the Frarm of Afghan dress with a local Afghan scoring or multiple waste-friendly and a moderate,
And I would like to see what a simple shaft of mine looks like by Kabul, between Kiplell Piplell P.99 to create a dialogue about the fact that today's development development development development development development development development development development development development that has its origins in the past-down rhetoric about the White man to protect the brown man itself and even even even even a civilized.
But for all these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, misrepresented.
But I do, because I have to because I have to because the geography of self needs.
That's my burden. What is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, just mentioned.
I feel like now, you know, I've been able to build a very uncomfortable tension in this room, because I shouldn't have that dress.
Fortunately, I'm having something to do with change.
This is the first time someone is attracted to TED stage, so you can appreciate being happy to see this, I think.
If some women were really embarrassed when I came out, you don't need to tell me this, I'll read on Twitter later.
I also think I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think of me.
It's not everybody who has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me up, so you're not doing anything as long as he's above my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
An image is powerful, but it's also a super-resolution image.
I've just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I actually never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should have been throwing my back and put my hand in this guy's hair.
And apart from surgery or the wrong bristades that I used to take for my work two days ago, there are very few ways to change our utterness, and our utterness -- even though it's super-explicable and irreversible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and I'm calling this a sexy girl in my business.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How are you going to become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a winning in the genetic lottery, and a critical legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and old and symmetrical, in which we are programmed biologically, but as big, feminine and bright-handed.
This legacy was created for me. And it's an legacy that's paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashioners might call "Halt. Naomi, Tyra Smack. Woman: Woman: Woman: Woman: Woman.
And first, I'm commenting your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious doctor in 2007, the first mode of NYU has counted all the modules on the sidewalks, each single one that was being executed, and that of 677 fashion models were only 27 or less than four percent of them didn't know.
The next question that's always challenged me is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And I first said, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventors of the next Internet or a Ninja-heart surgeon, which would be completely wrong, because then you're the first one."
If they still say after this amazing, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who is my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for nothing, and you could be the president of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meel.
To say, you want to be a model later, it's like saying that you want to win the Jack Prize in the lottery.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of model-based knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be unfolding.
And when there's a photographer there, and the light is just like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a picture in the run," now the leg first, and long, this arm goes back, this arm, this arm is on the back, and you move on three feet, and you just start to see, you see, you see, you see, 400 friends, you know, you know, you know, you know,
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and you've done a few jobs, and you're not going to say a lot more, and you're not going to say, if you want to be president of the United States, but you're in the room, "10 years of underwear." You're looking at funny.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who are all the photos going on?"
And yes, almost all the photos are being cleaned up, but this is just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photograph I've done, and it was the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know this is going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months ago with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this recording.
My girlfriend had to be embarrassed.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a couple of days ago, a magazine for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll see that these pictures are not images of me.
They're constructing, and they're building a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and remixers and photographers and Schylists and all their assistants and their pre-replications. They're building. That's not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Well, did you know, do you care for free?"
Yeah, I have too many 20-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-hop shoes that I can never wear, except the things I get free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and I gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a horrible driver, and she was leaving a red light switch, and of course we were stopped. It was just a one: "Sor, Mr. Words, Mr. Words," and we could go on.
I've got these free things because of my appearance, and I don't have the people who are paying for their own vision and don't pay a high price for their personality.
I live in New York and from 140,000 teenagers who have been shot and filtered over last year were 85 percent black and Latino and most young men.
It's only 177,000 young black black and Latino people who don't ask the question: "Am I going to quit?"
but, "How many times am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
And I found out that, in my research, 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States, we found out that 53 percent of all women don't like their body, and this number goes up to 78 percent when they became 17.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little thin and glowing hair, you feel very happy and scary."
And backstage, we'll give a response that might be given to this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never say before the camera, what I never said before the camera is, "I feel sorry."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I ever be happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool crabs, and they are because of their appearance, probably the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I've been preparing this talk, it seems very difficult to me to get a very honest balance, because on the other hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come up and say, "I've got all the benefits that have been dragged to my favor," and it doesn't feel very good at me, and it doesn't always make me happy, "And that's not always making me happy."
It was very difficult to really close a legacy of oppression for gender and race when I'm one of the largest buyers.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've done this here before 10 or 20 years ago, and my career has been still unlimited, because then I would probably not tell how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell, I would not tell how I've paid college, which is so important now.
If you take something out of this talk, hopefully we all hope that we all recognize the power of the image in our distorted success and misfort.
Thank you.
I've never forget the words of my grandmother who have come to life in exilation: "Son, paddafi resistance. Bearing him.
But never become something like a gaddafi revolution."
It's now almost two years since the world's been hacked by the bristby revolution, inspired by the waves of mass mass operations in both the ones in the Tunisian revolution.
I was connecting with many other Libyes, within and outside, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gadid.
And it was there, it was a big revolution.
Boy, gradians and men stood in the first row, they demanded the end of the regime, they held Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They have demonstrated an excellent mutant by judging against the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from far east to the far west, to the south.
Finally, after six months of brutally brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and to eradicate the tyrannics.
But Gaddafi left a great servant, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the basis of change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannical regime has destroyed both infrastructure and also the culture and the moral structure of the heteric society.
The devastation and the challenges, I burned, as many other women, re-growing civil society, and we asked a judged and re-regulated transition to democracy and national failure.
Now, to 200 organizations, while immediately after the case Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years, I returned to Lybia, and I started to organize some pretty detailed enthusiasm, and I started to organize workshops for the issues of creativity, human development and leadership.
And one wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Liby Women, a movement of women, leaders, leaders of different life, who are the goal to be able to come up with the sociological empowerment of women and to our right for equal leadership in democracy and education.
In the elections, I met in a very difficult environment, a environment that was vastly polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfish political politics of dominance and purpose.
I led a mission of peace platform to get women to a judged choice rule, a law that any citizen, no matter what the background should be, to vote for and to fight and to fight, and to address the political parties between male and female candidates and horizontal levels, and to make a constant balance and to make a constant balance.
At the end, our initiative has been taken and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation's head-of-the-the-the-year-century elections since 52 years.
But it was, it was safe, but certainly the euphor of elections and the entire revolution, because every day we started to have new news about violence.
We went to the marriage of the morning and we went to the post-war mosques and Sufi leaders.
On one morning, we got a message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then again, another morning, the wounded bombed the army was signed by the army.
And we're really, every day, we're facing the rule of the militians and their pre-cognition against the human rights of the human race and their neglect of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind, polarized and distant from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice -- who at first did.
Intuse, persever, and rifers became the icon of the Industrial Revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our pressing audience and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to confess that as a nation, we've met the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We've set our priorities wrong.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability in Lybia.
Did the hard-to-step and the change between female and male leaders have led peace and national acumen?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why is our society going to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and purpose, both men and women?
Perhaps the women were not the only ones that were missing, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the one who was.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a consensus shift as it needed to empower the elections, which ultimately has strengthening the polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of the anger and demand for a day of the rose.
We have to start acting in the name of compassion and the gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't only claim the next values, but also it's also composting: Gnade instead of collaboration, cooperation rather than competition, rather than rejection.
These are the ideals that need to be fought by a war of war, to get peace.
Because peace has an alchemie, and in this alchemie, it's about the reins of the feminine and the masking view.
That's the real real thing.
And we have to do this in general, before we do it, we have to do it in sociological.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam," peace <unk> "The word of the Good God, greeting."
The word "raheem" again, which is known in all the abagant traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "in Abouncy" and symbolized the maternal feminine, the whole humanity, all around the manhood and the female and the female, all of the tribes, all of all the peoples,
And just like the mother's heart of the embryo growing in his life, it's completely feeding the basic nature of compassion.
And so, I was told, "My Gnade is all about things."
And so I was told, "My Gnade has been pre-fosted before my brilliant."
Let's all be the kind of messing up to the gistade.
Thank you.
When I was a young person, I thought my country was the best country, and I grew up with the song "Nothing" on the world.
And I was very proud.
In school, we were pushing the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I was wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until changing everything.
At seven years, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer for hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from a colleague of mine.
And she said, "If you're going to get this one, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're dying soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about the first time that people were suffering in my country.
Shortly after that, I went through the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A crying woman was lying on the ground, and a broken kid in her arm was slipped helplessly in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because everybody was so busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
And at the end, more than a million North Koreans were sick of the famine, and many more of them were only surviving because they were eating grass, beetles and tree liars.
Lights have become increasingly and more and more common, so that at night, everything has been so blurged me, except the lights of China on the other side of the fish that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors on night.
This is the river of the amad, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very congested, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the devastating relatives to China.
I just thought I would be separated for a short time for my family.
I never thought it would take me 14 years to go back to life.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be as a North Korean refugee refugee, but soon I learned that it's not only very dangerous, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in silence fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare dream was true when I was caught by the Chinese police police officer and sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be a North Korean lady, so they tested my Chinese records and asked me a lot of questions.
I was so afraid of this, and I thought I would explode my heart.
If anything unnatural seems, I could be imprisoned and rejected.
I thought this would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished asking questions, a hospice officer said to the other: "This was a false failure.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some northern Koreans in China are taking in foreign messages called Ayl, but many are caught by Chinese police and announcing.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they were caught, they were finally released by massive international printing documents.
These North Koreans didn't have so much fortune.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are rejected to North Korea, where they are tortured, imprisoned, or legally displaced.
Although I was lucky, many other North Koreans don't go like that.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard for survival.
And then after they've learned a new language and they've found work, their world can be put on the head at a moment.
And after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
In Southern Korea, there was a bigger challenge when I thought I had thought.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I've also seen the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very different at each other, and we've been very different in the part of it, by 67 years,
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I a South or North Korean lady?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the adaptation to the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show at university.
Just as I was more successful in my new life, I got an audified call.
The North Korean authorities started taking the money I was sending my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to be moved to a remote place on the country.
They had to be able to fly as quickly as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made me back to the back of the Northwest border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to hire them, over 2,000 miles through China and then South Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we've almost caught several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese officer promised my family, I was determined, and he said she was a shower, and I was her locking.
He looked at me in a crazy way, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to go to the low-resolution border, but I had to go to almost all my money to get the border control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was imprisoned because of illegal border crossing.
After having paid money and paid cash money, my family was released within a month, but shortly, my family was replicated again in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I'd done everything to rescue my family to freedom, and we've been so close to it, but my family has been arrested just before the Southern Korean message.
I went and I went from the foreign authorities and the police department, trying to help get away my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back and pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man asked me, "What's wrong?"
I was totally surprised to think that a stranger is taking care of it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without being able to shoot a bank machine, and I paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized this was an symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger has been symbolized for me a new hope that the North Koreans have so desperately needed, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were united in South Korea, but the freedom of freedom is only one step.
Many northern Koreans are separated by their families, and once they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, education education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family workers, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would want to embrace hope for the fact that I would want to be able to succeed in Northern Korean, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see a lot more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just one request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big, very good.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't speak.
Remi knows what love is.
He's connecting them in unconditional, and he's sharing them inappropriate.
It's not a stupid thing. It's not looking at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to think of words that I'm not even thinking about, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has an absolutely unfinished memory.
but it's also a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate hats, but he remembers every book on my iPod's book, talking about when he was four, while the first episode of the teapleties on my arm and he had chipped on my grandmother and Gagah's birthday.
Don't you listen to amazing?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit in social version of normal, they often get over and understood wrong.
But what motivates my heart and my soul was that although that was the case, although they were not seen as usual, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and unusual.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compism," it's a complex disorder in the brain that affect social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's different in every individual, it's called Remi's different from Sam.
And all 20 minutes in the world, each 20 minutes in a new person is identified autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing interventions in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember when I'm sitting in autism for the first time, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very much scared.
He didn't want to play the other baby, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me.
Remi lived and re-in-elected in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, putting the washing machine and eating everything that came under.
And when he grew older, he became different and the differences became visible.
But behind the anger and the frustility and the never end of hyperactivity, something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any bias, a human who never had.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normal, the beauty that we have are giving us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right way.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not normal.
You can be an extraordinary one.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody of us has a gift in it. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying at the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Ed rapon has been filled with awe and curiosity with this photograph on a project on a photo, and it's a apple-sapted and a cold-time period of only one millionth.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we're not looking at the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion pictures per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femtoto Penios Peniosis, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can make time-lapse images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that are beyond our view of view, looking around corners or without an <unk>-ray image in our body and really ask what we're talking to with a camera.
Now, if I take a laser clip and I turn it into a billionth-by-halfth-by-half-step -- these are several-step-seconds -- I'm making a package of photonographs, and this photon pack, this project, is going to move back into light speed, and say, "Well, I'm going to say, a thousand times faster than a normal project.
So, if you take this project, this photon pack, and you take it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So, think about it, this whole event is actually less than a nanotore -- so long as the light needs to go back this lane -- but I'm trying to highlight this video by the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't funded this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, is put in the bottle with a photon stack that starts to move through, and then finally breaks inside.
Part of the light goes out on the outside of the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the steering bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that's coming around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are moving out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images at the end of the bottle after a few images.
Now, if you take a normal project and you leave it back the same route, and you slow it back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about something still-time photography?
You can see again how these waves are breaking the table, the Tomate and the wall over the back.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like a picture of nature, it looked like a picture of nature, every single photo image, but of course our eye looks a composted image.
But if you look at this Tomate again, you'll see that when the light is throwing up the Tom's light, they're going to keep moving on. It's not going to be dark.
Why is this? Because Tomats is coming up and the light jumps around her way and coming back after a few billionth seconds.
So, in the future, if this Femto camera is embedded in your Camerahandy, it could be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if a fruit is a fruit, without touching it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture of a short-term calorie period, you have very little light, but we try to make a billion times faster than your shortest calorie, so you're not getting as good as light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photo series, a million-dimensional package, and we're drawing it back and forth with very clever synchronizing, and we're combining these gigabytes of data to create these Femto videos that I've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data data and make very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superhero: can we see corners?
The idea is we're going to cool a little bit of light on the door.
It's being clogged, it's going to go into the room, and part of it's reflected back on the door, and eventually we can use these more nuanced twists of light.
And this is not a science fiction. We've actually built it.
You see, on the left, our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden in a soup, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the "Nature Communications Office," it was taken by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light project and we're going to wake it up on this wall and put this photon pack in all directions, and some of the photons are being pulled into the wall, and some of the photons will be able to break our hidden soup back, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light and a tiny number of light that photons will come back to the top time, but they'll get really interesting.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is about what distance is.
So by making a laser light, we can record a raw image, which is -- as you see on the screen -- not really makes sense, but when we take many of these pictures, dozens of these pictures, and we try to analyze the different light-through, then we can see the object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a lot of work to do before we can put this out of the lab in practice, we could build cars that can avoid and recognize what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous disabilities by looking at light through open windows, or we can build endoops around the body, looking at the deep in the sky, and also looking at the crater.
But because of the gloom and tissue, of course, it's very challenging why this is really a weather call for scientists, now thinking about Femto photography, because a new visualization approach could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as in Doc Edpton, even a scientist, a scientist, science has become an art of the ultra-grainy photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we collect every time, not only did the scientific process. We can make a new form of computer photography, and we can also take color photography, and we can only look at those waves between the wave of time, and we can't even look at the wave of time.
But it's also a bit fun thing.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves move away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost as we've seen light-speed, weird effects, and Einstein would have seen this picture incredibly.
The order of events in the world are appearing in reverse order to recurrent the camera, so by measuring the specific relationship between space and time, we can correct those biases.
So whether you're focusing on photography around corners or creating a new visualization for medicine or new exhibitions since our invention has been open up all the data and detail on our website and hope that the Fierakers and the creative community will show us that we should stop to step up on the x-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-viewing video-to-the-step interfaces.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we humans can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street so many of the discussions that we're not being passed away, but we're using the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the last few years, and use things like stickers and spets and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much renters pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without giving each other to each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is stalled by the giant osteps that have been bullying and groys for hundreds of years, drunk and crissors and crissches. I have a community of a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever never sees, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most abandoned areas in America.
I live near this house, and I've been thinking about how I can get it, and I've also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I lost someone I loved in 2009.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came out and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great grateful grateful gratitude for my life, and it's got me clarity about the things that are now important to me in life.
But it's hard to keep this view every day.
It's easy to lose your life in the daily lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the front door to a giant board in the front of the house, and I wrote a wall of the gaps, "In my life, I want to die, I want to come -- every one who can take a piece of chalk, and I can think about his life and share his hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled and grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"In my case, I want to be sued by piracy."
"In my wake, I want to stand on a broad-grained conclusion on the International Recession."
"In my wake, I want to sing for millions of people."
"In my wake, I want to plant a tree."
"In my life, I want to live in green-rel."
"In my late way, I want to keep them in my arms."
"In my life, I want to be a person's paper collection."
"In my own way, I want to be myself."
This neglected place was a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to cry and to cry and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and understanding our neighbors in a new way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important in our growing and changing.
I've done this last year, and I've received hundreds of secret messages that I've been trying to build with their community, so my colleagues and I've created a construction kit, and now in the world like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often stopped talking about death or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthen us most.
The idea of death shows us life.
Our common spaces are the best part of what we are important as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and our fears and stories, people can't just help us build better places around us, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in pre-leaching math. I'm doing a very special problem for anyone who is busy doing math, is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
dancing is one of the most human activities.
We're thrilled to look at the singing ballettet and beats, as you'll see.
On ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities and abilities, and possibly a fundamental statement that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slow down slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It's also what it does in my beloved Muslim Stripling, who was a balletviret at his time.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in the treatment.
Yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the inevitable symptoms like weaknesses, tremor, pearliness and others that cause this disease. That's why we need to find objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress objective, and ultimately, the only possibility to know whether there is healing, if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
And in trouble, there's no biomarky that there's no biomarkousity for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that's there is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means, outside of clinically studies, it never does.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It would not have to have a senior hospital.
It's 300 percent, by the way, to look at the neurological field.
So I want to suggest to you a non-conventional method that we're trying to do this, because we're all, in a sense, virtually like my Iranian grappet.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This is what happens in a healthy state, if someone's writing, we can look at us as a legitimate ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs, if we make them sound, and we all have the genes for FoxP2, for example.
And how ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until they're speaking.
And by the sound, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and the way the limbs are also affected by Parkinson's personality.
On the lower record, you can see an example of irregular vocal resonance analysis.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
True, weakness, sininess.
The language is even becoming a blind and airl and a wiper, and this is an example of a moptom.
And this impacts can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision analysis, combined with new machine learning, which is now advanced, we can now see where someone is in a pannelet between disease and health, just because of the vocal sounds.
How can these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test in neurologists.
It's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are accurate. That's not the case of experts.
So they can be done in their own own.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a high scale.
So this amazing goals we can do with this.
We can reduce logistics difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through the conventional observation.
We can do low-cost mass-cost training for clinical studies, and we can first study the entire population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's health community.
With Aculab and the patientLikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data for the ability to achieve these goals.
We have reputation numbers that are accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who, with no Parkinson's, can buy cheap to leave a few-hour recordings. I'm very familiar with joy that we've reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, say 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to tell in the call, whether this person has to suffer in Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you might not be able to get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, under various circumstances, which is interesting. Those conditions are important because we are testing these, to figure out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
Right now, you have 86 percent accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to urge him because he's done such amazing work -- now, has shown that it's working on the mobile network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
That means people can -- people can call up the phone and they can do the test. People could call their voice to Parkinson's disease so that your doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the back, you see the cows of my father, and the cows behind the front are the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the South, and it means that wildlife can rely on the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found them dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buocke.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes we came together with our animals and our wildlife habitats from heaven, so our animals matter.
I've been learning to hate lions for a child.
Our French terrorist named Morans. They protect our tribe and our loved ones. They're also supported by this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years for his father's cows. That's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this would not really help us, but the lions help us see the cows better.
But I didn't get on. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to use a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to be next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they look at the bird records and they go back, and the next time they come, and they come, they come, they don't really move, it's still here.
And they reach and kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the Stall. I was walking around a cliff in my hand, and this time the lions were not beating.
lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working all day for a little boy, and I was in my bedroom all day, and I was able to take my baby radio apart, and I was able to take my mother's new radio, and I was able to get it around the day, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a right-handed call from a motorcycle. It shows if you want to turn right or left. He's shining.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little snail from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar valve is providing the battery, the battery is providing electricity to the right-controll. I call it a transrogator.
And the right-contus is blinking.
You can see that the pads are coming outside, because the lions come from there.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are shining and the lions believe I'm walking around the bar, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been installing this in our home, and since then, we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I built the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they're really working well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including for other predators like hyops or leopard seals, and the lights are also used to keep elephants from farms.
My invention has taken me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has committed to the work of donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and we install the lights where there's no other, and I'll show people how to use them.
I was just a boy from the savanna one year ago who was crying his father's cows. I saw airplanes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one day!"
And here I am.
I was allowed to be a plane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and a pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to hunt lions. But by my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can do it together, side, with lions, without arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>nn. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. A electrode?
Yeah, I know electric fences have invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it already, right, yeah, I've tried it before, but I've left the trial because I got a blow.
All right, Richard Turder is hard. You're special.
We're going to hire you on every step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and none of them have done.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no possibility to shoot a picture. Not even being considered the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story begins when I was a talk for a TED Talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I hold my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57th and five.
So this is exactly a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture.
Well, you can see where this goes from ...
When my daughter daughter got closer, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do a father-daughter-law dance to keep the ritual going on?"
And then we started asking for a new tour tour tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're having a complete stranger,
Nobody ever said no one, and fortunately, nobody is still sitting with our camera.
We didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a moment of a moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us in October a week to keep the time and change the time we're going from year and how we're thinking about it, not just physically, but in everything.
Because as we do the same picture, our perspective changes from time, as they reach up new milestone, I can see life with their eyes, how they deal with everything, and how they see it.
And this very intense time we spend with each other is something we appreciate and expect to be happy every year.
In fact, as one of our travels, we walked around, and suddenly they suddenly stayed like they were, they show up on a red tag on a tomato store that had learned as a little kid, at earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings of emotion that she thought was five years old at the exact point.
She said she remembers her heart of her, when she saw her grandmother first nine years ago, she first saw the store.
And now she looks at high school schools in New York because she really wants to study in New York.
And I realized, it's a very clear thing. The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like in you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not at all a family photograph.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage everyone today to come to the picture and not ask someone, "Would you like to make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
