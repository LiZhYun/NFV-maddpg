When I was 11 years old, I was hit by the sounds of a kid in the morning.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was rather unusual, because the news was often depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power in Afghanistan when I was six years old, and they banned going to school.
And so I was hunted for five years as a boy and I was advising my older sister who couldn't do it alone, to a secret school.
Only that's how we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way so that nobody could guess where to go.
We hidden our books in shopping bags so it looked like we were just going to shop.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was a bit agile in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and every time, the class had to fall out for a week because the Taliban had spotted themselves.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to be rejected?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued and separated.
My grandfather was way ahead of his time.
A foreign stranger from a remote province of Afghanistan. He insisted that his daughter -- to send my mother to school, and was rejected by his father.
My mother-educated mother, she became a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to retirement just to turn our home into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family who ever got an education.
For him, he was always realized that his children would get education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He saw it as a much greater risk to not send his children to school.
I know that in the years of being so frustrated under the Taliban sometimes by our lives, of the constant fear and of the perspective of ignorance.
I was a good joke to give up, but my father said, "Meardy, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be displaced from your home in war.
But one thing will always remain you: what's inside of it. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school payments, we'll do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my old women have higher degree graduation than my high school degree, and if my family hadn't been so much used for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today as a proudly unoffin of the Midbury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first to congratulate me.
He's not just a graduate student, but also that I was the first woman and I was the car driving through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more and more dreams for me.
And so I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to start FILA, the first and perhaps only boarding school in Afghanistan, a country where girls' school school school workers are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how students in my school want to be able to sense their chances of the students.
And see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as my parents were then, despite all the time, despite all the due to the worse conflict.
Like Ahmed Ahmed. This is not a real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of a student.
Just a month ago, his daughter was his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they were the death of the road by a bomb just for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang and a voice beat it, if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.
And he said, "Well, let me leave you up if you want to, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the line because of your old and over-expived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've come to know something that is often defending in the West: behind most of us who succeeds, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that is knowing that her success is also his success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not going to matter in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are often more and more compelling to be honest with the future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, women's support is essential.
And under the Taliban, there were only a few hundred girls going to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, more than three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen from America, so different.
Americans recognize how unsafe these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not longer over time and are changing everything with the U.S. troops.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, they're encouraging them, I see a promising future and a lasting change.
Afghanistan, for me, is a country of hope and unlimited possibility, and every day, I'm remembered the girls who visit the SOLA.
Just like I have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, including a living -- my life -- was coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not -- -- -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, projects on the tech collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on my legs failed.
I was desperate.
I think 21 years, we were an Italian good person and we were making good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples of the Zambezi," was one where we were going to show the people of Sambias, how to grow food.
We got to the South Africa with Italian seed seeds; we got to this elaborate valley, which leads to Sambesi River, and we taught the local citizens to grow Italian tomato and tocini and --
Of course, local officials had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they began to appear.
We were amazed that in such a fertile valley, there were no agricultural agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Searst time to save people from the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderfully in Africa felt great.
We had this gorgeous tomato tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the Himalayan novels, "Look how easy agriculture is?"
When the tomato got to the red and the red, over the night, about 200 porkers came out of the river and dik everything.
We said to the Himalayan novels, "Oh my God, the Army!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have farming here."
Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so brilliant in Africa, but then I saw what Americans were doing, what the French was doing, and after I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
At least we fed the pier.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense that we've given to the unambigable African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, it's a peer-bian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read your book.
Read from an African, what we've done.
We Western humans are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways that we deal with people, and we suppress them, or we are patriarchal.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisisiv: I treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "b tyrug," they call the boss.
I was bathed as I read the book "Small's Beautiful" by "Dust," and he said, most importantly, in economics, if people don't want help, they will calm down.
This was the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, took a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocololatial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to just respond to people and invented a system called corporate promotion, where no one ever was initiated, nobody will ever be motivated, but you will become the CEO of the local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get to a community with ideas, you put yourself in the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in kitchiples.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends, and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for your growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your growing is the most important thing to be.
We're helping them find knowledge because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why, instead of going into a community and saying, what are they supposed to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
Entrepreneurs never have been in and they will never say public what they want to do with their money, what options they see.
Designing has this light spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be public meetings.
We work one to do that, to do that, we need to be producing a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the hospital of the company who sits with you in the house, in your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to transform life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia,
I was finishing my time and trying to escape the shattering flaw, where we tell others what to do.
And so I walked around the streets for the first year and I had my first three days of customers, and I helped him. He brought my little fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth, and he went to organize, and then the fishermen would come, and said, "You helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishermen work together and I didn't sell these wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents Fahrenheit, but to Japan for Sushi for 15 dollars.Kilo. Then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do -- I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I keep the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- and the government says, "Take it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the design of this.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on to loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter's printer said, planning is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurial spirit.
So you build Christchurch, without knowing what the smartest human Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get you to one.
You have to provide them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they will come in.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the most cheated thing for those of you guys that you've been listening for tomorrow?
"Ayeful, passionate people. You hated that.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We're at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- the calculatedable fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open-off species of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in a sustainable way, to cure, to exchange, and to exchange them.
The technologies are not there.
Who is going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it.
The government? Forget it.
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York in 1860s.
In 1860 they came together and they created what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York. The conclusion was, the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows in the speed, they needed six million horses to get people to get them to the point, and it would be impossible to get the crap done with six million horses.
Because they were already lying in crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive makers in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were tiny little factories in the backyard of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing to do is to be offered discretionion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolutely, very committed and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, everybody has to be able to perform three things: to sell the product, to be great, to be the market market market market, and the financial accounting needs to be enormous.
So guess what?
We never met a single person who can produce something, sell and care for money at the same time.
That's not what it doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We did research and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have all been mean to one thing: none of them was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 years of Southeast entrepreneurship, and we start giving them the lectures, and we start giving them the first two pages of Richard Bransons Autobiography, and the third two out of Richard Bransons's software visualization, as often as they use the word "I'm," and how many times the word "we" is.
Never "I" and 32 times "we"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small professional background, sit in cafes and bars. Their senior buddy, who are going to do for them, what someone here has done for this gentleman who's talking about this Eikas. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are helping organizations to help them find the means of the means and the people, and we've found that the wonders of the local population can change the culture and the economy of that community, just by taking the passion, energy and imagination of the people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be Alice in Wonderland.
So Penn State University asked me -- a Ph.D. for communications -- to try to connect engineers into communication.
I was afraid.
I'm really afraid. I'm afraid of these students with big brains and their big books and their big books, I don't trust them.
But when the conversation developed, he turned it to me like Alice, when she was carrying down to the pig's egg and saw a door to a completely new world.
And so I felt like I was interviewing students, and I was amazed by the idea they had and wanted others to find these miracles.
I think to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy, environment and health, and if we don't know about it, it's not going to go ahead. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religist, these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
I want to show you some of the attempts that you can do, that we can see that science and technology that you're engaging with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well, what?
Let's tell you why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only does your porkles study, but also tell us that their pores, their pillow, their little material structure in our bones, are examined because they're important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to get the word "nothing" or something.
In other words, there's a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use "discover" and time, but why don't you just tell you "space and time," what is a lot more understandable to us?
And to make your mind understandable is not the same as you're not going to go down to your level.
As Einstein said before, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with compromise.
So a couple of things to consider is that examples, examples, stories and analogies, so you can get us into your worm.
And if you present your work, you'll have the dots away.
Have you ever asked, why is it called the point?
What happens if someone else gets bored? One other one is getting stabbed, and with those dots, you get your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much for the wisdom-making part of our brain, and so we're very quickly challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the pigmentation is so stable that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, simple sentence where the audience can actually adjust the thread, act on the thread, and use images and graphics that also inform our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what you're describing.
These are just a few ways that we can help us open up the door and see the wonders of the world that science and technology can actually spread in.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the "Nerdin" eye in me, I would like to sum it up with a equation.
If you look at your science and your logs and your dipipe, it will be shared by the relevance, so the audience will say what's important, and multiply the passion you have for your incredible work: and it's coming up with incredible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solve this equation, I'm really excited about it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and provide a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can film a crime in the war in the Syria.
You can tweet a phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a phone, you can take a song and you can upload it to sound cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1904, and I live in Berlin.
So let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going to the road and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're imagining that all these people who have been born and asking change had cell phones in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your phones up, keep your phone up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, my phone wants to talk about me and my cell phone and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 points of information.
Brustable data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.R. has set up a policy.
This is a rule of law for law enforcement.
This rule is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service providers all across Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls who? Who's sending an email?
Who is sending text messages?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored on at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people have climbed up and said, "We don't want that."
They said, we don't want to have this reserve storage.
We want to have a digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of whom said, "We don't want that."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people were pouring up the streets of Berlin and saying, "Vongness instead of fear."
And some of them even said this could be a Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the headsteleat Force in Eastern Argentina.
And I'm also wondering if this really works.
Can all of this information really store over us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the German telecom company, who was the largest telephone company in Germany then, and I asked her, please, send me all the information you've stored on me.
And I asked her once and asked her again and I didn't get the right answer. Only another blue blues.
But then I told myself I wanted to have this information, because it's my life that you're doing in the line.
So I decided to put a court test on them, because I wanted to get this information.
But the German telecom said no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end, it was a comparison with them.
I'm going to take the message back to what they demand me to send information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court mandated that the E.U. was the headline of the German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 points of information.
I first saw it and said to myself, well, it's a huge file. My journey.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, "Well, I want to go to the public with this information."
I want to get it published.
Because I want to show people what is the case of law enforcement.
So with time online and open data City, I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and down.
You can track every step I do.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to K<unk>l, and how many calls I walk along.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like this, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we talk a couple of times.
And then a couple of friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call yourself up and you call yourself, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, what time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who is the leader of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a map of countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who talks to who to talk to who to send an email, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said earlier, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi knew who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders were, that might have never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall may not have happened.
And then, not the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so much information as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all the time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is an issue in the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, tell your persecutors, just because companies and state communities have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to struggle with your own self-driving in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: hyult shops, rapid restaurants, brkops.
So the city planners meet and they survived changing the name of South Central to make it happen to another, they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what's going on in the city wrong.
This is South Los Angeles.
Mastery shops, rapid restaurants, bureaucracy.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the Drivebys.
The great thing is that the Drive-thrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in a way that they're curable.
For example, my life obesity rate is five times higher than it was in Beverly Hills, about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't really get that one.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, you see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I realize that the driveers bought and sold like the car flee.
I see cometic centers jumping up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I was paying 45 minutes to get an apple that was not sexually sensitive to pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park park.
It's 45 to four feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to get care of it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility and I have to stay in."
And I decided to keep it in the same way.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, together, and we started planting my food forest and fruit trees, and all the program, vegetables.
We're a kind of executive group together, composed of gardening from all walks of social backgrounds and all the city, and it's totally voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically assigned me a plane, and said I had to remove my garden, the supply was going to become a champion.
And I thought, "Okay, come on, right?
A common set of dependencies for growing food on a piece of land that you're totally not comfortable with?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand with it."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and spoke to the town, and a member of Green Ground Ground Ground Zero, and they signed a petition on Change.org and 900 signatures, we were successful.
We stopped the victory in our hands.
My town board even called up and said they support it and love what we do.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the largest store in the United States in the audience in the ownership of the city.
They have 4,800 square kilometers in Brack.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should they not find that right?
Through building a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my Heaventy, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of this preconceived reality made by other people, and I built my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Homework is my graffiti. I'm harvesting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls are filled with me, I swear lawns and equipment.
I use the garden, the earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my valves for this stuff.
You would be surprised to see what the ground is capable of doing if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my backyard as my garden was an instrument for education and development of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the floor.
You would wonder how children are affected by this.
So gardening is the most therapeutic and the most bold act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you also get strawberry strawts.
I remember that time that her mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 o'clock in the night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a cause to the road."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that just empowered me to do that. People told me, "Fin, you're not afraid people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Forthum devil, no, I'm not afraid they're going to be doing something.
But that's the road.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back their health."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even though, maybe just for a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people who came and they were doing it, and they were all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, they eat the food charcoal.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get any of those, if they didn't show how food and body influence affects, they will blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids who are right on the path that they were looking for, and that's not going to lead them anywhere.
I see the gardening as an opportunity to train these kids to care for their communities to live a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the soil, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. That's what I want to do.
I want to plant an entire block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a shipping container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The great thing about sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and letting them experience the pride and honor when you build their own food, and when you open farmers' markets.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to be that we're all becoming all environmental rebels, gangsters, gang gardeners.
We have to turn the picture of the sq.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You know, you're going to get a ham butt, right?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me if you sit in the square chairs and you want to make a meeting where you talk about making any shit.
If you want to meet me, come with your knees, into my backyard so that we can plant any shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "the more unfair politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper accounter gave birth to a better definition: "A snollygoster is someone who is a foreign minister, independent of party, program or performance, and success, by the pure power of the monumental hormone.
I have no idea what the "laying" is.
Something I think is in words.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers couldn't get the exact same vocabulary of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who went back to Parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it up, but he was courageous enough, he was brave enough to get heated, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the sentence "so strong" as Brass." Many people think.
and they're more likely to be on the English word for the tin.
But that's not true. It's back to a liberator of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time that it has just reached independence.
You'd look at the question of, how do you call George Washington, the head of state?
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican nation?
And there was a widespread debate in Congress for a long time.
And there were all kinds of predictable suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call it Governor Washington, and others, his high-city George Washington, and others, and the protection of the freedom of the people in America's United States of Washington.
Not that special.
Some people just wanted to call it king.
They thought that was preventable.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a particular period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with a little bit of embarrassment because this debate lasted three weeks.
I read the diary book that always wrote, "Once the same topic."
The reason for the stretion and boredom was that the Kansas House was the foreman of the Senate.
The representative house was not going to have Washington be a great thing. They didn't want it.
King call it, and maybe even gives it to ideas about his outcome.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most pest, most daunting title that they could find.
This title was "Poteor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he just meant someone in a gathering.
It's sort of like a preaching of a jury.
He had no longer the size of the record as the sign "discovery" or "rave water."
Sometimes there were a couple of head-up leaders and government groups, but it was really a unremarked title.
That's why the Senate refused to leave it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy has to sign up the agreement and meet foreign wage receives.
Who's going to take it seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't come.
Instead, they were supposed to be the title of the State, not to be the case of the story, but they were absolutely clear that they were not going to agree with their honest respect for the opinions and civilized nations, whether it was in the Republic or monarchy, where it is the case that the state of the presidency doesn't fit in the attis -- the president and the other nations's interests of the United States,
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One, and I think that's the best -- I couldn't figure out if the Senate ever put the name of the president in a formal way.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just awarded the title. He just waits for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something is temporary -- -- -- you'll be going to get 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, and that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today sounds so humbly, right?
It has to do with something more than 5,000 nuclear weapons that it has and the largest economy in the world and a bombing drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title of scale.
And that's how the Senate ended.
They got a respectable title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the meaning of being religious -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations do you have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear bombers and so on.
So at the end of the day, the Senate and the representation of the house lost, because nobody feels humble when you're told you're the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and that's what I'm going to leave with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the words change much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I got to a truck with about 50 Reppels at the fight for Moalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to check my black-in-the-white gloves against a pair of brown leatherodals and fire a rocket towards the government headquarters I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time before, I'd been big with war, but next to Pyjama party and football talks and hand-ups with racist Southeasts and pre-religist demonstrations that never had a "No one had ever been to ski with communism and Afghanistan" and to tap out the post-up images before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here now, a kind of, a well-intought Afghans, South-world researcher by God Gnaden. An atheist and a radical political artist who has lived in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So there's a lot of really amazing things in Afghanistan that you could make about art, but personally I don't like painting rain tales. I want to make art that connects the personality and informs authority and re-visioning reality and even using a kind of imaginative citizenship to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- notice, that it's used to protect its jihad, like "Pophead," and it uses armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else could jihad have done when Parliament went for a year and do a choice campaign with the slogan: "Take me! I'm jihad and I'm rich."
And trying to use this campaign to break these Mafiosi, to spend as a national hero.
I want to go to the bottom of the corruption in Afghanistan with a project called "reachstour," where you're a police station, you build a false control center on the streets of Kabul, and keep cars on the streets of Kabul, but instead of taking bribes from them, providing money to them, and in the police department, they're hoping that they're going to take us 100 percent of them.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan, I think, has become the Intermodic conflict.
The war and the stranger who came along with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a forensic training for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine the furs of Afghan people with a protective clothing or multiple different warehilled metal into a moderate, Western-realized reality work.
And I'd like to see what a simple pusher in Kabul looks like in Kiplings's Appell's Pourello, to create a dialogue that today's development organization is developing its origins across ancient Colombian rhetoric about "The White" have the "The Virgin" to protect the brown man from themselves and maybe even a little bit of humanitarianizing them.
But for all of these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood, they can be misintered.
But I do, because I have to because the geography of self requires it.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for some time I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, that's exactly what I've said.
I feel like this is now a room that's now building a very uncomfortable tension, because I shouldn't have dress this dress.
Fortunately, I have something else to change.
This is the first time someone is wandering at the TED stage, so you can appreciate the fact that you can see it.
If some women were really slipped when I came out, you don't need me to say this, I'll read this later on Twitter.
I also find that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think of me.
That's not everybody who has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to carry them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're going to get all of you going to wake me off, so don't do anything until it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
A image is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to drop my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgeries or the wrong brine that I took two days ago to work, there's very few ways to change our utterance, and our utterance -- even though it's super-exportible and irreversable -- a huge impact on our lives.
To be fearless, to me, is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I stand on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my industry, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important heritage, and you might be wondering what this legacy is.
Well, in the last few decades, we have defined beauty not just as healthy and young and symmetrical, where we are mechanically programmed, but as big, slim, feminine and bright-brain.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been taken to me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point. And maybe some fashion agents might call, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smanalls. Liu Wen."
And first, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU counted all the modules on the runway, each one of them being treated, and that of 677-take models were only 27 or less than four percent of them were not known.
The next question that always gets asked me is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And I first say, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can get anything.
You can become the president of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja Heart Monker who was completely wrong, because then you're the first one."
If you still say after that great retrieval, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who is my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the president's editor of American bird or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to become a model later, it's like you're going to get the Jackpot in the Lotto.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I'd like to show you 10 years of model knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be unfolding.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a picture," now the leg first, beautiful and long, this arm goes back, this arm is going back, and the head is on three feet, and you just move back, and then you see your hand back up to your, 400-second, 400-second, 400-year-old friends.
It looks something like this.
I hope it's less strange than it is in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and you have a whole time and you've done a few jobs, you can't tell much more. If you say you want to be president of the United States, but in your lifetime, "10 years of underwear," you'll be looking at weird.
The next question that I've often been asked is, "Who are you raising all the photos?"
And yes, almost every single picture is being cleaned up, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I made, and that was the first time I carried a Bikini. I didn't even have my time back.
I know that's going to be quite personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months earlier, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this film.
My friend had to sing me.
This is me on a Pyjama party a few days before a magazine for French birdgy.
This is me with the football team and the V-book magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you'll see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructing, and they're constructed by a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and remixers and photographers and Stylists and all their fellow assistants and their pre-engineering and post-engineering. They're constructed. That's not me.
Okay, so next thing, people always ask me, "Well, you're not doing stuff for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-inch shoes I can't possibly carry, except the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a horrible driver, and she was walking over a red light, and of course, we were stopped. It was like, "Excuse me, Mr. Wachtters," and we could go on.
I got these kind of free things about my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who look and don't pay a lot of money for their personality.
I live in New York and from 140,000 teenagers who have been shot and filtered last year, 85 percent black and Latino and most of the young men.
It's only 177,000 young black men and Latino, who don't think of the question: "Am I stopping?"
But, "How often am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
And in my research on this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is 78 percent, if they became 17.
The last question to me is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think you'll expect that answer to that: "If you're a little bit thin and humilious hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backstage, we'll give an answer that might give you this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of that is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never said before the camera is what I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I'm unsure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I going to be happier if I had thin legs and shiny hair?"
And then you'd have to meet some of the modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool little nudges, and they're probably the ones that look at their appearance, probably the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really hard to get a honest balance, because on one hand, I felt really uncomfortable to get me here and say, "I got all the benefits from a stack that was being messed into my favor," and it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that's not always making me happy."
It was very difficult to unite a heritage of oppression for gender and race if I'm one of the biggest beneficiaries of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done this here, before 10 or 20 years or 30 years, and my career has stayed still, because I wouldn't probably tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I paid college, which is so important.
If you take a little bit of this talk out of your talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our supposed successes and failures.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother that had come to life in exile: "Son, I've got some Gaddafi resistance. Get it.
But never become something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's now almost two years since the Libyan revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass mass customization in both those who are in the Egyptian revolution.
I joined a lot of other Libyers, in and out of nowhere, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrant regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, most of the women and men stood in the first row, they told the end of the regime, and they held Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They proved an astronomant by asking for the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the south.
After six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we were able to free our country and to reduce the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a great brush, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the basis of change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis tyrant regime has both destroyed infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I knew how many other women, helped restore civil society, and we asked for a sovereign and unchanging transition to democracy and national balance.
Near to 200 organizations, while immediately, Gaddafis in Benghazi, were founded almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybia, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops, human development and leadership development.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the leadership platform of Libyen women, a leadership movement of different life-to-day women, whose goal is to be publicized for the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and to our right to equal policy in the democracy and peacebuilding.
In the general election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was vastly polarized, a environment that was defined by the selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I led an initiative to the leadership platform of Liby women to achieve a regulated rule rule, a law that every citizen, no matter what the back should be, to vote for and to be in charge, and most importantly, to establish a relationship between a male and female and female and even vertical-scale and narrow-scale and to make a constant gift.
At the end of it, our initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 17th percent of the national debate in the first year of state elections for 52 years.
But it was very, very clearly, the history of elections and the entire revolution, because every day we started putting new news on violence.
We went to the marriage of ancient mosques and Sufi masters of the morning.
In another morning, we got a message about the murder of American ambassador and the attack.
And again, another morning, the murder of the army was recruited by the army.
And we really woke up every day under the sovereignty of militias and their ongoing potential against the human rights and their abortion of laws and laws.
Our society is formed by a revolutionary state of mind, polarized, and distant from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they had at the beginning.
Intolerance, decay and revenge became the icon of the "Folult" of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our pressing audience and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to make sure that as a nation, we have made the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We put our priorities wrong.
Because elections didn't bring peace or stability or safety in Lybia.
Did the hard-to-dist and change have brought women's peace and national acumen?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why is our society still polarized and dominating selfish politics of dominance and purpose, both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the purpose of that.
Our society needs a national dialogue and convergence as it needed to have elections that have only increased polarization and decoration.
Our society needs to have the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting on behalf of anger and asking a day of revenge.
We need to start acting on behalf of sympathy and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just appreciate the next values, but it also raises the case: Goffade instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, by extension.
These are the ideals that need to help you get yourself out of war,
Because peace has an alchemy, and in that alchemy, it's about the relocation of feminine and masking view.
That's the real punch.
And we have to implement that in existential terms before we do it socio-Indically.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam" -- peace, "is the word of the Good God, raping."
The word "raheem" again, known in all the abrally-an traditions, has the same Arab root as the word "rahem" and symbolizes the matal feminine, which surrounds all of humanity, of the man and the man's and the female, all of the tribes and all of the tribes.
And just as the mother's abdomen grows into the embryo, completely surrounds the basic nature of compassion to the whole existence.
And that's why we were told, "My Gnade is all about things."
And that's why we were told, "My Gnade has prefussed my gree."
Anyone who's going to be freeed to the Gnade.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up using the song "nary" to be a little bit older.
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn very much about the world out there, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until I was changing a changeable time.
At seven years old, I saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter to me, my mother, from a colleague of mine's sister.
And he said, "If you did this, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore because we've eaten nothing anymore for two weeks.
We're all on the ground together, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly after that, I went past the station, and I saw something horrible I couldn't erase from my memory.
A Saudi woman was lying on the ground, and a child in her arm was bleeding helplessly in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because they were all engaged in taking care of themselves and their families.
In the mid-'950s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were killed to sacrifice, and many more others survived because they ate grass, and beetles and tree canopy.
So electricity loss grew more and more, so that at night it was going to crash me, except for the lights of China on the other side of the tag that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and its neighbors at night.
This is the river of the ampay, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very, very scary, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to China for the devastating years of famine to the remote relatives.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take 14 years to get back together.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have an idea of what life would be like as a North Korean refugee refugee, but soon I learned that it's not only very, very dangerous, but also because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in a constant fear that my true identity could fly in, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny in North Korea.
One day my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police and sent to the police department.
Somebody gave me a parent of North Korean, so they tested my Chinese convictions and they asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
If anything unnatural is, I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the polling, a government official said to the other one, "That was a misguided thing.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are using foreign messages called agyl, but many are caught by the Chinese police and being rejected.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they got caught, they eventually released out of immense international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have that much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are released to North Korea, where they are tortured, imprisoned or publicly held.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard for survival.
After they've learned a new language and found work, their world can be turned on a moment in time.
And after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I was a bigger challenge in South Korea than I would have thought I was in South Korea.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I also noticed the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've become very divergent, because of 67 years of division.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northan-nore?
Where am I from? Who am I?
All of a sudden, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the adaptation to the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show at university.
Just as I became more common in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities started taking away the money I was sending my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to be a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go through an incredible distance on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China and I moved to the northan border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run it, spend more than 2,000 miles in China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride lasted a week, and we almost got caught.
One time the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed, and told him they were muffy, and I was her confer.
He looked at me in a righte, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get it to the low-resolution border, but I had to almost get my money to get the border control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and paid money, my family was released within a month, but shortly after that, my family was re-fipped back, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest disengage in my life.
I had done everything to protect my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went back and forth between the foreign authorities and the police department, trying to get rid of my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back the bribe or money money money.
I lost all my hope.
And the man's voice asked me, "What's wrong?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is taking care of it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without shooting, he went to a bank machine, and he paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get it out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger has shown me a new hope that the North Koreans have so desperately needed, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of international community as the hopeer, the North Koreans need.
After all, after our long journey, my family and I were back together in South Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as they arrive in a new country, they start out with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family workers, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would like to pursue hope to succeed in the North Koreans with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have one request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce my brothers to you now.
Remi is 22, big, very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't.
Remi knows what love is.
He's not going to reveal them, and he's going to reveal them in a way that they don't.
It's not a pity. It's not paying attention to the skin color.
He's not taking care of religious differences and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, sometimes he's trying to think about words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: How little we know about minds and how wonderful a unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
It has absolutely unconditional memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate pillars, but he remembers every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, the first episode of the teapleties on my arm and put on my mom's Day's birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and understood and wrong.
But what motivates my heart and my soul was empowered is that even though that was the case, they weren't usually seen, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and unusual.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex disorder in the brain that affect social communication, learning and sometimes physical skill.
It's a different thing to think about in every individual, so it's so different from the hook.
And every 20 minutes in the world, they'll find autism in a new person, and although it's one of the fastest growing-growing advances in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been through autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized it was different.
He screamed a lot.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and reorganized in his own world, with its own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row of places, putting the washing machine and eating everything that was in it.
And when he was older, he became different, and the differences became visible.
But behind the raption and the hune and the never-death hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been lied.
Remarkably.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea that they taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normal, the beauty that matters to us, the differences that make us, and the fact that we're different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right kind of thing.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each one of us has a gift in it. And all of us, honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment that we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
And Doc Edgerton has been bothered with awe and curiosity, and this photo on a project that's inflated an apple and a catapic-lived period of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we see the world not with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create a slow motion of light into motion.
And so we can build cameras that can look outside of our perspective or not see any <unk>-ray image in our body and really ask what we mean with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it into a billionth of a second -- these are several times a second-by-second -- I'm going to create a package of photons that hardly a millimeter wide, and this photon pack, this project will move in the speed of light, and, as I said, a million times faster than a normal project.
So if you take this project, take this photon pack and you shoot it into this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So remember, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotore -- as long as the light takes to get back this route -- but I'm going to try to get this video down to the order of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't funded this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, takes a pack of photon pack that starts to move through, and eventually that breaks inside.
A part of the light goes out to the table and you see that spread from the waves.
Many of the photons eventually achieve the melting of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that's sweeping around the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflective length, you see the reflection at the end of the bottle are focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and you let it go back the same route and slow the video back at 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- -- from a slow, normal projectile.
And what about a still-life photographer?
You can see again how these waves are going to slide up the table, the Tomate and the wall upside down in the background.
It's like throwing a rock in a pond.
It seemed to me that nature would paint a photo like this, each of which was a femto image, but of course our eye is a composed of a folding image.
But if you look at these Tomate again, you'll see that if the light goes over the glass, it's going to keep the light coming up. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomate has arrived and the light is going to be going around you and it's coming back after a few billionth of a second.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is installed in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you could go to a supermarket and find out if a fruit is stagnated without touching it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with a short amount of air time, you have very little light, but we're going to adjust a billion times faster than your shortest degradation time, so you're not going to get as good as light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this projectile, this photo-packing pack, a million times, and we're drawing it back together with very clever synchrony synchronizing, and we're combining these gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superhero: can we see corners?
The idea is that we're going to put some light on the door.
It will be clamking in the space, some of it will be reflected back on the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use that double-fold of light.
And that's not rocket science fiction. We've actually done it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is a puppet hidden, and we're going to be able to break the light on the door.
After our paper was published in the National Communications Service, it was taken by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light project and it's going to slide up on this wall, and this photon pack is being poured into all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will then break the light back, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light, and then a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but most interesting, they will be able to be different in one time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skill.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And so of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is that we don't know what the distance is.
By making a laser light, we can take a raw image, that -- how you see on the screen -- don't really make sense, but then we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and we put them together and try to analyze the different light reviews, can we see that object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit more work before we can put this into the lab in practice, we could build cars that will avoid collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous flows of survivors by looking at light through the open windows, or we can build endcopes that look deep in the body around Okkard and also.
But because of the blood and tissue, that's a very challenging thing, of course, why this is really a web call for scientists, now think about Femto photography, because a new one-time model could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, science has become a technology, an art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we're collecting every single time, not just the scientific processing process. We can also create a new form of computer photography with time-lapse photography, and color analysis, and we can only look at the wave between those wave, and all of time, and all of the wave of data is not just
But it's also a bit fun happening here.
If you look at these waves under the tube, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What's going on here?
And it turns out that we, because we have nearly caught light speed, we have weird effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The sequence in which events in the world appear in the camera in reverse order, so by applying the context of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So whether it's for photography to focus around or to create a new model for future language or new forms of education, since our invention, we have all enabled data and details on our website, and hope that the "pierakers and the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop taking our step on the xenels of the cameras and start to emerge in the next dimension -- and start to emerge in the next one of the next one.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives in humans.
We don't meet every neighbor in the street so many discussions don't get passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors and to use things like stickers and crunchons and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without disturbing each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned building and understand the landscape better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being reassured by the giant osteps that have been among hundreds of years of loving, drunk and depressed shadows, and I trust a city where there are always music.
I think every time anyone never sees it, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the left-up parts in America.
I live near this house and I thought about how I could get it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great grateful gratitude for my life, and it brought me clarity about the things that are now important to me in life.
But it's hard for me to keep this view on a daily basis.
It's easy to lose and forget to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I transformed a page of the abandoned house into a giant blackboard and I wrote with a wall of passage in the ceiling: "If I die, I want to die, I want to -- anyone who can come back, take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely crowded, and it grew.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"First I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"On the time I die, I want to be more complete on the International Recession line."
"First I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"First I die, I want to plant a tree."
"First I die, I want to live in green-friendly."
"First I die, I want to keep them in my arms."
"First I die, I want to be someone's cavalry."
"First I die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to cry and to moan me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and trying to figure out how to do it in a new and more meaningful way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this this last year and received hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction kit, and now in the world like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces if we have the opportunity to rise our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, to look at things with the right look, and think that life is short and delicate.
We're often being stopped talking about death or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation to death is one of the things that strengthens us most.
The idea of death reveals us life.
Our common spaces are the best to show us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and our stories, people around us can't just help us to create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in targeted math. I'm a particularly special problem for anyone who's been involved in targeted mathematics is that we're as a business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try to explain to you what I'm doing today.
And dancing is one of the most human activities.
We're thrilled to look at the mastering ballet and be loaded together, as you'll see.
Now, for ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental determination that a genetic component could have.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly break out this extraordinary ability. That's what it does to my beloved Jan Stri province, which was a ballet deal at his time.
Over the years, you've been making a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people in the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the inevitable symptoms of weaknesses, tremor, adulthood, and others who are causing this disease, and that's why we need to find objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure advance objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there is a cure if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
And in trouble, there's no biomimacy for Parkinson's and other other people, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing there is this 20-minute test at neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials, it's never done. Never happened.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a sermon tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't have to be a working hospital.
It costs 300 percent, by the way, to look at the neurological department.
So I want to suggest to you a unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a sense, virtual reality like my Iranian and hermital epitage.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal sound cliffs.
This is what happens in a healthy state, if someone makes speech sounds. We can look at it as a mood ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all of these vocal organs if we make sound, and we all have the genes for it.com2, for example.
And how ballet requires a huge amount of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to be when it's learning.
And by the way that sound, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal sound, and just like the limb is affected by the muscles of Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of irregular vocal resonance fones on the bottom.
We always see the same symptoms.
Regoric, weakness, sininess.
The language is even becoming more wiser and wiser and eternious, and that's an example of it.
And this impacts on the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision processing software combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now see where someone lies in a lub of disease and health, just because of the sounds.
How can these tests be measured with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test in the neurologists.
Not so much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both of them are accurate. That's not what the arguments are done for.
So they can be done independently.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds at the bottom.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also put it in a high scale.
So we can do this amazing goals.
We can reduce logistics problems for patients.
Patients don't have to perform routine checks in the hospital.
We can get objective data through a wider view.
We can do low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials and can first study the whole population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's disease-based area.
With Aculab and patient babies'Like, we'd like to take a very high number of voices worldwide to own enough seed data for the investment of these goals.
We have reputation numbers that are capable of three-quarters of a billion people on the planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's or Parkinson's can actually dial a cheap way to leave a few-cent-hour recordings. I'm very familiar with delight that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of them, say, 10,000 people, you can tell who is healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to tell in the call, whether this person has Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you may not get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in various circumstances, which is interesting. These circumstances are important because we're going to be able to go out and find out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
Right now, are your 86 percent accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done such fantastic work -- showed that it's working on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
That means that people can -- people can call up the phone and do the test. People with Parkinson's call Parkinson's call, send their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
That's right.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya at the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see my father's cows, and the mine behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the south, branching in, and that means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night. I woke up in the morning and I found them dead. It was horrible. It was our only Buump.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we would come with our animals and our urban habitats from the sky, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I was only as a child who was learning to hate lions.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our lovede. They're also brought to this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park, there's only so few lions.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for the cows of his father and nine years old. That's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Bears fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, it would help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird's disease.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow's.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird magazines and you go back. But the next time, they come and they say, well, the thing doesn't move, that's still there.
And they reach out and kill our livestock.
One night I woke up the rubble. I walked around the hand with a torch around him, and that time the lions didn't get caught.
Bears fear light, which moves.
I had an idea.
I was working all day in my room, and once a while I was a little kid, I actually took my mom's new radio apart. And that day she was getting me almost around. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a motor control plant out of a motorcycle. It suggests that you're going to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little leaf from a broken flashlight.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is integrating the battery, it's providing electricity to the right-player. I call it a transformer.
And the right to the right is to be flashing.
You can see that the sins are pointing outwards, because they come from.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights blink, and the lions believe I'm walking around the rubble. And I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I put this in our homes so far, and since then, we had no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights on. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've fed seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good at work.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including for other predators like hymen or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved and helping fundraising and education through contributions.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in and together where there's no other lights, and I'm showing people how to use them.
One year ago, I was just a guy from the savanna who was smuggling his father's cows. I saw planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of my day."
And I'm standing here.
I was allowed to get on an airplane ride for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a pilot and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to hunt lions. But through my invention, I can save my father's cows and the lions in common. We can live side by side with the lions without prejudice.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's next on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. An electroenceable fence?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, not yes -- I've tried it a little while, but I've given it back because I got a blow.
It's hard. Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you on any step of your graves, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I'm old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite slides; and not one of them I did.
There was no kind of a director, no styleist, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting was seen.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random round tourists.
My story starts when I was a lecture in New York, and my wife made this picture where I held my daughter on my first birthday on my arm, and we were on the corner of 57th and fiveth birthday.
And so a year later, we went back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this goes from ...
When my daughter's third birthday came up to say, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do a father-daughter leadership to continue the ritual?"
And at the time, we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a complete stranger to take your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately nobody has ever been washing up with our camera.
At that time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This one was taken just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened that day, so that a five-year-old could understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a given moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a chance for us to be in October a week, to stop time and to change our time and how we're coming from year to year, not just physically but to reflect in everything.
Because while we're always making the same picture, our perspective of time is going on, as they're reaching new milestone, I can see life with their eyes changing with everything and how it looks.
That very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value and expect for every year.
And recently, as one of our trips, we walked for a walk, and suddenly they remained as determined, and it shows up on a red mark on a dollboard that they had learned as a little child, at the previous stages.
And she told me about their feelings that she had thought was five years old at that point.
She said that she remembers her heart hopped out of the chest when she saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks at high school schools in New York because she's really interested in studying in New York.
And I realized that it was obvious: the most important thing that we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you this idea of taking an active role in conscious memory-making.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but apart from those 15 pictures, I'm not on a family photo.
I'm always the one who makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come to the image and not ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 27.69, 58.1/35.0/22.6/14.8 (BP=0.964, ration=0.965)
