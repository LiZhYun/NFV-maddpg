When I was seven years old, I was a night-t-dled joy of the pody,
My father heard a little, little, beautiful, high-dimensional video, the movie of the Apple.
He saw a lot of, which was a pretty unusual, because it's the news,
He called, "The FBI are left!
I didn't know what that meant, but it was really fascinating, very happy, very happy, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said, "I'm going to go to school."
I never never hear this morning.
A real school.
The FBI's power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and she was married, and she was married for school.
So I was a little bit of doing five years old, and I was a teenager who had to have to have lost my old brother, not to be working for a high school.
Just just we could go home.
Every day, we got another way to think that nobody could have seen where we went.
We were in our books in our high-up, so it's so that we'd just go to the same.
We were in a house, about 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a little, but it was incredibly hot, and it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that our lives were our lives: students and our parents.
And again, the classroom had to be a week of a week, because the FBI had been left.
We were never sure how much they knew us.
They were all doing us?
Did they live in the places?
We had fear, but we wanted to go home.
I had a lot of work in a family, in education, and I was interested in the education and the friends.
My grandfather was very long-term.
A high-time-time-American, he was going to send his daughter -- my mother, and his mother was born by his father.
My mother was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the hospital, just to build our house and women in the city.
And my father -- this was the first family in his family who had ever been a school.
And it was also very clear that his kids would be a school, even the first two legs, even the FBI, even the same.
He saw it as much more effective than the kids don't buy their kids.
I know, I'm still so happy in the 1970s, sometimes as a life of our life, the fear of fear and the un-cacination and the visualness of the visualness.
I had good, but my father said, "Look, I'm sorry, please, I can be able to lose your life.
You can buy money. You can be taken in the war.
But one thing is, you're going to always always always always go from this: and even if we're going to pay your blood to your home, we're going to be able to pay to the money to do that.
So you want to be able to be a little bit of a day?
Today, I'm seven years old.
I grew up in a country that grew up by the civil war.
A half of the women in my childhood, a high-term school than the school, and when my family were not so much so much so much so much so much as my family, I had been able to be a lot of women.
Instead, I'm sitting here, as a teenager, as a high-American school.
When I went to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was born by his family, because he was forced his friends to send his friends to the first one of the first, the first one of the first, the first, I was a very popular, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
He's not just with my school, but also I was the first woman, and I was the first woman who's going to go through the car.
My family believe me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more creative dreams for me.
So I'm a global business for 1011 dollars for education for women.
So I've been working with the first, Polas, and the first school for girls in Afghanistan, in a country, in a country, in school, and still, is a little bit more likely to be a little bit more more than the school.
It's wonderful to see how the students were in school with a very high-term skill.
And to see how their parents and parents are in their time, as my parents and even to be the more vulnerable and more vulnerable.
So as John. That's not the very real name, and I can't show the face, but his father is not just a friend of my students.
A month, his daughter were his daughter, and he was in the home of San Francisco, and they're the death of the street, and they're only a half minutes.
When he went home, the phone, and a voice of his daughter, if he went to school, he would try to go back to school, she would try to try to work.
He said, "I'm going to be a little bit of my brother, but I don't want to go to the future of my daughter's favorite ideas and personal ideas."
What I've been thinking about was something that is that the West is, most of us, the most of us who have the father, who are the father, who are the person who are actually aware of his daughter, and that it's not the reason that it's a success is not a success.
That's not the reason that our mothers don't work in our success.
They're often more likely to be more and more more and more more more more creative in the future of their eyes. But in a society, but also as a society is the women's health of women.
The FBI went to a few-year-old girl -- because it was dead.
But now, in the prison, three million girls in the school.
In Afghanistan, it's been in America, so different.
The Americans see how effective changes are.
I'm sure that the changes are not the changes of the world and they're all changing the U.S.S.S.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I look at school school, and their parents who are willing to be able to be able to be the ones that I'm going to find a very successful future and a lot of future.
In Afghanistan, for me, is a country and the rest of the potential and the more creative ways, and remember my girl who went to the news.
As I did, they have big dreams.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, but I'm working with life -- about seven years ago, about the work of the work of women than young man.
In 1978, I see young, but I'm old, but it's not -- but I have -- I have the South Carolina, California, California, California, California, and the research of the world with the global world with the global countries.
I worked for a German C.S.S. and every single project we had the legs, and I met the legs.
I was very happy.
I was, 20 years ago, we thought that we're good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we had all been able to do what we did.
Our first project, which was the first book called the Surt, which was a journalist in the Surt, which we wanted to show people as food as food as food as food as food as food.
We went to the Italian park in South Asia, and this craid, which is the Surt of the Surt, which is the local of the European Union, and we've been using the local of the European weapons of the European Union and the European Union.
Of course, the very high-term interest were not really interested in the work, so we were working with work, and sometimes they also started working in work.
We were very surprised that it was a very low-tech growth.
But instead of asking why they don't have any open, and we just say, "Oh, let't be happy, that we're here!
"Tight" at time, people to save the people of the Samaian,
Of course, there's a wonderful thing in Africa.
We had this high-tech, and it was so big, in San Diego, so big.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how it's called Europe, like it's called growth."
When the flies were left and the red, about about about about about about about about about about about about about 12,000 feet of the river and the river.
We said, "Oh, God, the pam, the p-h-h-h-h-h-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
And they said, "Yeah, why we don't have growth here."
Why did you not say, "You never heard?"
I thought we were so good in Africa, but I saw the American, but I saw the American English, which was what I did, which was the French, which was what I did was doing was really happy, which was really excited about what I was doing in our project.
We were just able to put the pod.
They should see the bad -- you should see the bad ones that we should have no impact of the African people.
They should be the book called "Monooo, who is a super-in-in-American biologist.
The book was published in 1998.
We have the largest continent in the last 15 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been made.
Just just read her book.
You know, you know, you know, a group of people who have been doing.
We're the Arab people, the neurosas, the mission, and there are two different species that we're using people with people with them with them with them, or we're called neurophosicial.
Of course, the words are from the Latin cortex, which means "wat" is called "cat."
But they have two different different forms of different things.
Sogic: I'm going to make every different culture as they were, as they were my children, and I love you so much.
Ryston: I'm going to make a different culture as she would be my brother.
So so the white people are in Africa called "Jeopardy" and "Jeopardy""
I was a little bit more, and I was a book called "Taty" and he said, especially, especially in the economicization of sustainability, if people don't want to go to help people to help them, and they don't want to make people in the economic sector.
That should be the first way to help the help.
The first result is a passion.
Today, the guy who took the conference, a knife, and asked me, "How do you think, "How do you think you're a city that's not the pononian?
When I was seven years old, I decided to be able to be able to be able to be a company called a system called a system, and someone who never will never be a little bit of the local community, but you're going to be a lot of the local community, but you're going to have a better family to be a better person who will have a better person to be a better person.
What you do -- you're going to make the teeth.
You never never have a community with ideas, you're going to get a high-tech team.
We don't work from schools.
We're going to put in the street. We're going to put in a po.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're looking at friend and find out what the person wants to be.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can be a idea of somebody.
If this person doesn't like to do what you should do?
The hard for the cost of the population is the most important thing.
The hard for the own, is the most important part of humanity.
We help them to find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful.
The person with the idea, maybe the knowledge can not be done, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this a strategy: why instead of a community and to say, what they should be asking them to hear why they're not going to hear why they're not talking about their community?
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community.
Women never never have a business, and they never say what they want to do with their money, which are what they want to see their potential for the possibilities.
So we have this little pod.
The most people don't know because they never seem to be in public school.
We work to do something that you need to have to have a social systems that don't have to be in the world.
A new job has to be done.
This is the house of the company, the house of the house, with your house, and in your house, and you're going to find your own relationship to find your passion in your own life, to find your passion in your own life.
I've been in this in the South, South, the Arab world, trying to work.
I was working in the time and trying to say, where we say, where we're going to say, what they're going to say about, which they're going to be going to be going to be able to be done.
And so I went to the first year, and I had the first two days of the first two days. I went to him and he was a fish in a street, and I was a little black restaurant in a street, and I went to buy him in a restaurant, and I said, "You'd never put a house to help them to help us to help him, and they're going to help them to help us to help us to help them to help us to help
I went to five,000 of these fish and work with this wonderful cave, not to buy a cell in a tree, but to sell the <unk>1,000 dollars for 12,000 dollars, and then they said, "We've got to help them to help them to help them and help them."
And I had been in a year, and the government came to me and ask me, "How do you do you do that?
How do you do -- "I said, "I'm going to make a little bit, very difficult.
I feel the legs and I hear them."
So -- -- so, the government says, "Look, let's go back."
We did it in high-tech communities.
We've been working in 500 companies.
There's a new generation of companies who are in the memory.
John, one of the best companies of the history of the history, died with 12 years ago.
John II was a wonderful artist before he was working with companies, John Hillis, which is a real thing with a social society and economic society."
So education is the death of the leadership of the human leaders.
So you're going to build a packer, not to know what the most human human human man is with their money and their money.
You have to learn how to make this one to get a little bit.
You have to support them and education. You have to help them to help them to help them, and they're going to be very great, and they're going to be able to be able to be able to help them.
In a community of 10 people, we're going to get to 500 companies.
Can you imagine a community of 500 people who are the intelligence and the creativity?
What do you have to be the most of the most of the time?
<unk>-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
I want to say that women are the right way to be the right way.
We're the first revolution -- the first global warming, autonomous solar, and suddenly there are the systems that are not effective.
The drone is not sustainable.
The high-tech is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we can use seven billion people in the way, to use them to use them, and they can use them with them and to make them in the way.
The technologies don't exist.
Who is the technology for the green revolution? Do you write?
The government? Please be!
It's a leader. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a great scientific biologist in many years ago.
There were a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of New York City in the last year.
In the 18 and they got together and they were made them together in a five years ago, which would happen in the city, which was a very popular city. The city would not have been a huge part of five years.
Why? You saw the surface of the surface, and they said, if the population is going to be in this particular, they needed to be six million legs, and it would be impossible to be done with the young girl.
Because they went in the cold.
In the 18 and three years, they see the high technology that's living in New York City.
What happens? In the United years later, in the United States, there were 100 dollars per trillion dollars -- 100 dollars.
The idea, another technology, had the secret, and there were little forests in the South Asia.
San, the name of the Apple.
There's a secret to work with education.
First, they have to be trained by the secret.
And they're not talking about you and talk to you.
So next, you have to give them a very powerful and creative business.
And then you have to hear the real truth about the women's news.
Over the bottom of the biggest company, you have to be able to be able to pay three things: the new product, the need to be the international and the financial financial financial.
How do you think?
We never have a single person who can use something like the same time and make money.
It doesn't exist.
This person never died.
We've been working with the 100-tech companies in the world -- the Solas, the Colas, the Colas, the new companies, Google, Google, Google, Google, New York.
There's only one thing that have the most successful companies in the world, only one person has been built by a person.
Now, we're talking about five-year-old women in North Carolina and we start to give them the first two sides of these two sides of the first two of these photos of the first two of the great things. The first thing is that it's the first two-year-old names of the two-American names of the first two-American names, and they're also also also also using the word "Jeopardy"
No, "I'm a half and eight times."
He wasn't just as he started.
No company had no one company. No.
So we can build a community in the engineering, a small side of the TV, and you're sitting in the TV, and you're going to be the pam, and you're going to be able to do somebody who's going to do this guy who's doing this guy, and you're going to say, "You're going to be wondering, "You're going to be wondering, "You're going to be going to be going
What can you make it? Can you make it a decision?
OK, you can buy it? Can you make money to make money?
"Oh, no, no, I can't be like, "I don't know, I'm sure you're going to feel someone else?"
We use communities.
We have groups that are used to help the companies, to help people to help people and people and people, and we found that the moral system, the social system, and the social system can also change the social system, and also the way that the social relationship can be changed with their own relationships.
Thank you.
I've been interested five years ago, and I've been interested in the humanities.
The University of London, I was a writer for social communication -- to be in social learning.
I had fear --
The right. The best fear of these two different brains and their big books and their big books, not to me, not to be a great words.
But as a lot of the research, he built me as John, as he got down, and he saw a little bit of the door, and he saw a new world.
I felt like, when I was talking about the students with the students, I was surprised about the idea that they had thought that they had the other amazing questions, and also the other amazing thing that the other amazing thing was that there was a result of the Everglades.
I think to open this door, it's a great social communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and the ones that are the biggest problems of the global problems, and health and health, and if we don't know nothing about it, and it doesn't understand it, and I don't think that it't think that it's not a lot of the responsibility in our business.
But this great conversation is not going to be a lot of our scientists and scientists don't have their questions in the Southeast.
So scientists and scientists, please let's go back.
I want to show you some of the examples of how they can see that science and technology with you, and the science that you can see is very exciting with you and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer is, and what?
And so, to us, why are your scientific research for us as well as well as well as we're doing.
Don't just tell us that their pars, but also, that they're also able to find their blood, the blood, because they're using our blood, because they're important to understand that they're important to understand that they're important to understand that they can be to understand and to understand that.
And when you're seeing what they're doing, they're going to be smart,
Now, the key thing is that there are a huge understanding of your mind.
And can you use their time and long-term, but why does you say, "We don't just say, and how much more difficult to be, and how much more important is that?
We're trying to make your idea, it's not the same way to make their same.
As Einstein said, "Hoo things like this as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible, but not make it easier."
You can tell us something about your scientific development without making the business.
A few things are to imagine: stories and creativity and interactive, and interactive ways of this way.
And if you were trying to go back and take the lines of the lines.
Have you ever asked me why it's called the real term?
What happens when someone's going to be a different thing? And you're going to be just looking at these numbers, and with these first two dots, your first audience.
One of the examples of this is not just a little bit, but also to be very careful in the front of our brain, and we're very quickly to be more excited about it.
This is a lot of neurososos, which is a lot of powerful, and it shows that the visual structure is so that it's so that they're also actually actually the very difficult to describe the visual design of the design of the design.
The trick is, one single sentence, just to use a specific sentence, to make the audience, and even if it's going to be the same images, the images, the images, the images, and also the other images, the other moments of our physical experiences, and also to make the sense of the way that they're going to make a sense of the sense of the way that they're going to be a sense of the way that they're going to be able
These are just some of the ways that help us to see this door and the wonderful thing that the science and the science of technology.
The scientists who taught me to learn with the <unk>amp<unk>amp<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk><unk> <unk><unk><unk><unk><unk> <unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk>
And in your science, your visual feedback and your visual feedback, and you're going to look at this, so the audience is important, and the key to your relationship with your work is to your work with your great work, and you've got a huge amount of new models.
So scientists and scientists have the structure of this structure, and I'm really interested with me.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my phone.
A cell cell can be a life and a personal identity.
So you can use a car in the city of humanity in the park.
So you can take a phone and you can start a little bit of a little and a little bit of a sudden in Egypt.
And with a cell, you can take a song, it's a little bit of a little bit of a game, and famous.
All of this is a cell.
I'm in 1989, and I live in Boston.
Let's go back to this time, and let's go back to this city.
You can see how many people go to the street and they went to the street and moved.
We're in the winter, and we're looking at all these people who were going to be able to find the changes and the changes of the brain, a cell phone.
Who has a cell in the room?
Just take it up.
Please take your cell, you get it!
Just take it. A TV, a finger, beautiful, beautiful.
These are many. No, every one is now a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 12 degrees of data.
Cillions of data.
And why are these information in there?
Because in the summer of the T.S.S.
This is called the actual line of the drone.
This is what every car-based car-based car in Europe, every Internet-based, a massive set of bio-based systems.
Who's the message? Who's going to be a paper?
Who's going to be a video?
And if you're using a cell, where you're in a cell.
All of these information are going to be about five months of your phone phone phone phone or your Internet.
And everywhere, people were sitting in Europe and said, "We don't want to go."
They said, we want to be able to be able to be able to be a non-creatable.
We want to be able to create self-dimensional, and we don't want to be able to use that the software and the Internet and all these information in our own machines have to use information.
There were teachers, the team, the people who said, "We don't want to go."
And here you can see how many people were in the streets of Washington, and they said, "Hat, "watity, and "watity, but they said, "wat, "wat-cistity,
And some of them said that this could be a packer.
The pony was the podan in South Carolina.
And I also ask myself whether it works.
Can we really make this information from us to use information?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my company, the New York company, the largest company in Germany, and I asked her, "You know, I asked all the information to me to get me out of the information.
And I asked her and she asked them, and she didn't have the right answer. It's just a little bit of a little, very low-a-a-a-a.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that she's working with it because it's the way they're using it.
So I decided to build a study of a study because I wanted to make this information.
But the <unk>amp<unk>amp, no, no, no, we're going to give this information.
And the end of the end, it was a little bit more than they were.
I'm going to put the pow, and what they've been able to get all the information.
Because in the past of the military, the key to the C.S. is the original thing in the middle of the weather.
So I got this little, and I got a little bit of a little bit of a TV.
And on the left, this is what it was.
Seven feet of information.
First, I saw it, and he said, well, it's a huge photo. My favorite guy.
But then I realized a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this mountain.
So I was a little bit of fun, which I should try to start with this?
Because you see where I'm sitting in the night, which I'm sitting at night, which I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to go with this information with the public.
I want to make them a little bit.
Because I want to show people what is called the drone.
With time, online and online data, so I did this.
This is a visual experience of six months of my life.
You can go and look at the light and look at and forth and forth.
You can make every step I'm doing, and I'm going to make it back.
And you can see how I went from John Kurt, and how many flies do I do with the door and how many flies I do.
All of this is possible to make this information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, it's just like, I'm going to call my wife and she's talking about me and we're talking about a few times.
And then I'm going to call a few friends and they're going to call them another.
And after a while, you're going to call you and you're going to call this huge network.
But you can see how people interact with each other, when they're going to send each other, when they go home.
You can see everything.
You can see the most of the main figures that are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control the society.
This is a building for countries like China and the war.
This is the perfect design, like you can use a society, because you know who's talking about who is talking about who is going to write a email, all of you can do this information.
And this information will be high for five months, to Europe, to South Africa.
As I said, we'd ask us that all these people in the street in the middle of the cell phones in the middle of their little cell phones.
And the pans had been able to know who was in the stage, and when the CEO were the leaders who were never seen, the leaders were never going to happen.
The case of the Amazon, maybe the Mola could not be done.
And yet, not the case of the air of the ceiling.
Because today, the international weapons and companies have to make a lot of information, how they can make them over and forth and forth.
They want to keep the ability to keep our lives, and they want to make the whole time that we want to make it much more long.
But even self-term and a life of the traditional age is not a real one.
But you have to fight the self-interest today.
They have to fight every day.
So if you go home home, you say that your friends are a value of the 21st century, and that's not a traditional age.
If you go home home, you say, you're going to say, because you're going to give you a business and companies, you have to use a certain information, and they have to use it to use it long enough.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your company to get information, which you've got over the information that you've got on.
So in the future, every time, if you're using your cell phone, you remember that you have to be able to fight the self-term self-termity of the traditional age.
Thank you.
I live in South America.
This is South Carolina: It's a very, very, very, very high-tech, open spaces.
So the city of the building and then the name of South Carolina, so it's a different thing to change it, and it's also the way to change it as if it changes something that's happening in Los Angeles, what's going to change the city.
This is South California.
Todons, high-freat, open, open, open spaces.
So like, three million Americans live in the food of California, the home of New York City, the New York and the S-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-S
The high is that the secret of the pody, more people eat than the man's name.
People are dying in South Carolina in California,
The traditional growth in my middle is about five times more than the Surty, which is about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about the South Carolina.
I couldn't have any more of the things.
And I asked myself how you would have no longer survive food, if you're going to go to the house, if you're going to see the effects of the negative power, the effects of the food, the power of your food.
I'm going to be able to eat the pets and kill the way that they're going to be used to be used to be used to be a while.
I see the sports-based, like TV.
And I realized that the ones have to stop.
I used to find that the problem is the problem.
food is the problem and food is the solution.
And also, I didn't have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of time to get a mouse that is not a little bit of the non-catial.
So I went to a food-up house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park.
It's about three feet.
The thing is that it's heard about the city.
But you have to be more effective.
So I think, "I'm a Ph.D.I can make what I want to do with my responsibility, because I'm going to be a responsibility and I have to be in a way to be in it."
And I decided to be in the way.
So I went and my group, the T.S.C.C.D.D.D. So we started to build my food and forests and forests, so they built the whole program, so the whole software system,
We're a kind of new set of plastic, all of the different relationships of the city, and it's completely completely difficult to do everything we do, and everything we're doing is not high.
And the ceiling is beautiful.
But then someone else is getting a little bit.
The city came to me and he was a completely different, and he said, I have to use my knees, the pow, which was a very un-creatable.
And I thought, "Well, yeah, yeah, right?
A lot of the technical drones with food, which is a whole country that is pretty good, is you not really happy?
And I thought, "I thought, "I'm going to make it."
Because that's not what it would be left.
The T.S. Times got this guy from Danny Rolas, and I talked about a story with a city of the city, and with a member of San Francisco, and you were a series of neurosonons, and we were very successful.
We had the head of the hands of the hands.
My city had no, and he said that they're working and love what we do.
So, really, why should they do that?
T.S. has the United States in the United States of the city of the city.
They have a hundred miles of air.
This is 20 in San Diego.
This is enough to build 500 million vehicles.
Why should they find that not cool?
and with a plant, you're going to give a thousand pounds of seeds.
With green flowers, you're going to get a dollar and blood and blood vessels in the cost of about 40 dollars.
It's my brother's training, I'm saying that people are going to save their own food.
His own food is like to fly your own money.
Look, I have a leader in South Carolina.
I grew up there. I have my brother.
And I'm more more, part of this particular view, to be the different reality, the people who were made me and I'm very my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
I'm a blog. I'm going to put my art.
It's like a wonderful designer, the walls, the walls, and I'm going to open and air.
I use the air, the Earth, like a little bit of a little bit of the trees and the trees are the trees and the trees are the forests of my own.
They would be surprised what the whole water can use everything when you use it as a camera.
They can't imagine how amazing a sun is a red, and how they feel people feel.
So what happened?
I've been interested in my own house for education and the socialization of my city.
To change the community, you need to change the power of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wondering how children are being influenced by their children.
So the main thing is the very high-tech and the very-lestestestestest, and the one that you can do, especially in the city.
And then you're also going to make a little bit of plastic.
I remember this time when this mother came and her daughter, she was about 10 seconds old. They were in my room, and I looked at my room and I looked at them and I looked at them and I looked at the room.
I was really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you know, you know, you're not going to do that.
The ceiling is not a reason of the street."
I've been going to be a lot of people who were so cold and so cold, and that's just my way to do it. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk> <unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk>
And I said, "Well, the hell, no, no, no fear that they're not afraid of what they're doing.
And it's also the road.
But that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want to get their health to go back to their health.
And I took a window in this room in the jungle, and I put a packer in the T.S.
These are the guys who have learned to make the pow,
It was cool, and she was working with the stories of how they've changed their mother and she was very good to see how they're in their mother and she was really great to see how they're changing it as a moment.
Tolas have been so much of the caves of 20 degrees.
And we got to the micro-creaters, and they were all the people and they're all working with all the work.
When kids eat cars, babies eat.
If they eat fruit, they eat.
But if they didn't have any of them, if they didn't have the physical body, and the physical body, they're also going to eat, and they're also going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
I see young people who want to work, but they're going to put it in this thing -- I see the same kids who are the right side of the line, which is the way they're in the front of them, and they're not going to be in.
The other way I see is, where we can save these kids to help their communities to improve their communities to improve a new life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could use the next night of Washington,
But if we don't change the speed of the river, we're never going to do that.
So this is a one of my students. So I want to do that.
I want to share a whole high-based food where people can share the same-time.
I want to put a little bit of the air and make it in a healthy house.
So you don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about food, because it's not enough.
The technical innovation is that you have to be able to be able to be in their own.
I'm talking about people who are working in the streets and children to get the joy of the music and the joy of the joy of the joy, and the joy of the joy of the personal food, and when you're going to use food and food.
So what I want to do here is that this is cute thing.
I want to be able to be able to be the same-based, the pody, the pest-fest-f-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
We have to move the picture of the slime mold.
If you don't have a pow, you don't have a pod.
So you're going to be a little bit of a py, clear?
And let's take the gun of your choice.
If you want to get up with me, you don't want me to be in a pat, and you want to make a meeting where you want to talk about something where you want to talk to you, or you're talking about somebody else, you're talking about it.
If you want to get me, you're going to go to your hand, in my room, so we can make any little bit of the food.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite favorite favorite names in the middle of English is "m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
Because it sounds like this, it sounds like that.
And "Monon" is called "wat" for the good doctors."
Even though, a little bit of a new language, a normal language, a pogon, someone who is a school, or its main drone, and its own performance of its own, and its own performance of the visualness of the visuality of the visualness.
I don't have a idea what the "m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
I think, some of the words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of the politics and all the teachers who have to be trying to control the language.
In 1978, for example, the British, the Great War, not the same word of the word of the word of the word of the Sabbus.
And that was actually going to go back to the man with the amazing name of the great name of the Sukan, the University of the study.
They got in the park and she took him in London, but he was enough enough enough, and he had enough enough enough to be to be able to be able to work in London, and he had so much money in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first-term app for the sentence as well as a lot of "laty" have a lot of people believe.
And they're going to be in the English word for the English.
But that's not true. It's going to be going to be a professional strategy.
But to show you how words are, like the weather and politics are, I want to take you into the United States, and I want you to take it in the United States as they've been actually done.
You saw the question of how to call John Washington, the local, the state of the world.
They didn't know it.
How do you call the leaders of the American country?
And it was made by the law of the early-term.
And there were all sorts of kinds of smart things to make it more.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the name of Washington, and other, his name of Washington, and other people, the people who were the people who were in the United States of America.
Not so much as a pod.
Some people wanted to call him a female.
They thought that was a result.
They were not a non-cist, they wanted to give the king to a certain time.
It could work.
But everybody was a little bit of a little bit of fun because this research was a little weeks ago.
I met the days of a book called the same thing, "I'm going to be the same term."
The reason for the cost of the car, and the more difficult thing was that the re-cest-up was the end of the bus.
The NSA didn't want to be the Washington, and it's not going to be a pody.
The king call, and it could be able to make your ideas to the end of his hand.
They wanted to give his most, very popular name, the most famous name that they're using.
This is called "The Recess."
The president. They didn't have the name. But he was actually able to have a conversation to be a meeting.
So something like a powy.
He didn't have a size of times as the "cat" or "cat."
Sometimes, there were little and small-term groups of government and government, but it was really a really un-c-cunist quote.
So that's why the pag was going to get it.
They said, "It's funny, you can't call him him a name.
This guy has to be trained and the local police.
Who is going to take him a little bit of a little quote called the United States of America?"
And also three weeks ago, the drone didn't have been done for the end of the gang.
Instead of the game, it's not to use the word "The Book" but they wanted to be really clear that they were not really afraid of their own skills and the international issues of the world, or not because in the United States, because it's not the world, because it's not the rest of the world, because it's not a lot of the world, because it's not a lot of the world, because it's not a lot of the
You can learn about three interesting things.
First, and I think that I'm really sure that, until now, I don't find out whether the CEO has ever been the name of the name of the President.
Alexander, who was the name of the name, he'd just be just a little bit of the pody.
Second, you can learn that if a government is a little bit more, a bit of it is -- you're going to wait at five years later.
Three, and that's really important to be the most important part of the word is that the word of the United States today are not so bad, or so that it's not so bad, right?
It has a little bit more than a half-tech, which has the largest world and the biggest world of the world and the main software and the whole little of these stuff.
And the reality has been the size of the size.
And so this has been the end of the end.
They have a more un-term name.
And the other fear of the pony, the pony of self-creating, so that was so that.
But you know how many nations have a president?
Seven.
Because they all want to be like the guy with the eight-tech, and so forth.
So the end of the mountain, and the pony of the bus, because nobody's always a little bit more vulnerable than you're told you, if you're going to be the president of America.
And this is the most important thing that you can take, and I'm going to give you a little bit of what I'm going to give you to my email.
Now, teachers are trying to use words to change the reality and change reality, but also the reality of the words, more than the words, more than the same words, the same words,
Thank you very much.
So I went to a little bit of the high-up in the prison, a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, the Sananan, the Washington.
I'm going to be a black-old-foot-and-old, and I'm going to put a little bit of the government in the government, and I couldn't see that I could never see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was a long time with the war, but after the war, I'm going to go to Turty and write with the podas and the podies of South Asia and the traditional and the visties of the local and the non-cacial and the non-catial, and the non-created, and I didn't know, and I knew that in the public, and I didn't know, and I didn't
But this is the visuality of the self-s.
And so I'm here, and I'm going to be a high-tech, South Asia, South-American, a political biologist, and a great biologist, which has been working in the last 15 years in Afghanistan and working in the last 15 years.
So there are a great things about Afghanistan, but you could make art, but I don't like to make the music, but I want to make the joy of the joy of the joy and the joy of the knowledge and the visuality of the world, and also the way to find the way that they're trying to find a very specific reality in the world to make the world to be able to understand the world to be able to understand the world.
I want to spend a day of a war -- a terrorist, the peace of the local, and the "laton" and the "caton" and the political political and political politicalism to create politicalism.
And what everybody can do is that the law of the National Life is to make a choice and a choice with the "T-R-R-R-R-R-R-I. I'm dangerous."
And to try to use this campaign to use these Kananii, which is as a student.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "cat" as a word of the cars, but with the car-tatial control of the cars, but instead of their money, but to give them money to the police, but to give them the police to the police, to the police, to the police, to the police, to the police, to the police, to the police, to the police, to be able to help them to be able
I want to look at how the conflict of the war in my age, is a natural culture.
The war and the most powerful moments that came to him, a new environment for the open and the way you can just use a collection of the poders and the podies of the police and the podies of the local, and I'm going to use a non-freated with a high-catatial, with a high-catial, with a high-catatatatatatatat, with a high-in-in
And I would like to see how a simple podon from California, from 18 to create a conversation to create a conversation about the world that they're going to be able to create their most of the most of the financial reports in the world, to be the very popular, to be the very popular, to be the very popular, to be the very black-cist, to be able to protect the man, and to be able to protect the man to be a little bit of
But for all these things, you can be able to be surprised, and they can be surprised, and they can be surprised,
But I do it because I need to make it because the visual self-esteem is to make it.
This is my favorite. What's your mind?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Danny Watson and a few years ago, I work as a model.
Over 10 years ago, just, I'm sure.
I have the sense that there's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a memory, because I didn't want to be a little bit of the paper.
Fortunately, I've been a little bit of trying to make it a little bit.
This is the first time that someone's working on TED Talk, so you can be happy to see that, so happy to see what I think I think.
If some women were very difficult, when I was, you need to say, I don't have to say that, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to talk about Twitter.
I also also feel that I'm very happy because I can change a lot of seconds, and I can change what you think about me.
And everybody has no chance to do that.
These are very aggressive, it's good, so I didn't have to stop it.
The most difficult part is to move through my head, because you're all going to be able to be able to do anything than it is old.
Right.
Why did I do that?
That was a little bit.
Well, it wasn't just so difficult to see this picture.
A visual picture is incredibly powerful, but a visual picture is also a very different.
I've just changed your own view in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never been in reality, a friend.
I felt very creative and I told myself to go to my left-tat, and with my hand with my little white hair with my hair.
And even after the treatment or the wrong-up, I've been talking about two days for the work for the work, there are very few ways of our ability to change our ability to change our own models and our own models, even though it's a huge impact.
And it's not a very honest to be honest for me today.
And I'm sitting on the stage because I'm a model.
I'm sitting on the stage because I'm a beautiful, beautiful, white, and I'm going to call my school a girl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people always ask me, but the more difficult way to make the real way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered, but that means that it doesn't exist.
The real reason, like I was a model, a strategy in the genetic, and you might ask you a very important challenge, and you might ask you, and you might ask you, that's what's the secret.
Now, in the last few years, we have a beauty of humor, and young and old, we are also responsible to be a very effective, but also as big as big as a big, but also, very large, very high-lam, and very high-fam, and so,
This was a mission for me. And it's a success that has been made me to be a success.
I know there are people in the audience who are in this particular point. And maybe some of the things are like, "Monon, Ponon, Pooon, Pooon, Pooon.
And finally, I'm talking about your model. It's pretty interesting.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in the year, a very high-tech company, all the things that were the most of the very popular, every single, the only one that was made by the only four-foot-created, and it was not only five percent of five or less than five percent.
The next question that's always going to be told me, "I'm going to be a model if I'm older?"
And finally, I said, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to give these little girl, "Why why? Why?
You know what? You can be all the things that you can be.
You can be the president of the United States or the CEO of the next Internet or a p-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
If they're still talking about this great, "No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm going to say, "I'm going to say, "My brother."
Because I didn't have a responsibility for nothing, and you could be the secret of the American American, or the public school of the next to the next to the next to the next to the next.
And so you're going to say that you're going to be a model of a model, so you're going to say, you're going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the guy in the pystery.
You can't be able to control it, and it's not a wonderful career.
Now I want to show you 10 years of the digital model, because it can be different than heart-American, but it can only be just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just done.
If there's a team, and it's the light, like a beautiful, and the police says, "Aah, we want to go back to a photo, and then we're going to go back to the short-time, and then the little bit of his leg is very beautiful, and then you're going to see, and you're going to see that little bit of his head, and you can see, and you can see, and you can see
It looks like this.
I hope that less than the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happens.
If you're sitting in school and you've got a lot of work, and you can't say, you can't say, you can't say, you're not going to say, you're going to say, you're going to say, you're going to be a lot of the president, but you're going to be a little bit of the great, but you're going to be called the U.S.S.S
The next question that I'm often told me is, "Where all the images have the images of the images?"
And yeah, so, so all these images are completely made, but that's just a little part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was the first time I had a Ph.D.D. I had a Ph.D.S.. I didn't even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even before my time.
I know that's pretty difficult, but I was a young girl.
I just saw a few months ago, with my grandmother.
I'm this day of this guy.
My friend had to be a little bit of my friend.
I'm a pory-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
I'm with the school and I was in the New York Times.
And this is my last today.
And I hope you can see these images are not some of my images.
It's the collection, and it's a group of a group of pody, and the neurosas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the other ones and all the police and the police and the police and the dolphins and the dolphins, and they're not.
OK, as the other questions, people ask me, "You're going to be doing things?"
Yeah, I have a lot of paper-t-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
I grew up in Ghana and I went in a house and I had my money. And you had my money for me. And you had my house for me.
When I went to my friend with a beautiful brother, and she was a red light, and of course, and we were just left a red box, and we had a little bit of the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, we could go back and we could go back.
I have this little things because of my eyes and not the memories of my memories and the people who are the same way to be the same way of their personality and not to pay their own personality.
I live in New York and the 12,000 of the year, and the whole year, were covered, and they were seven, and they were seven, seven men and young men and young men.
It's living in New York City, only six young, black, black, white, and white, who don't have the question to say, "You know, "You know, "You're going to be going to be going to be sick?"
And it's, "How often do I be going to be angry?
And I found this talk for this talk that 80 percent of the five-year-old girl in the United States, not like the number of their body, and they're going to be in the United States, when they're killed.
The last question is, "How is it a model to be a model?"
And I think they're likely to find this answer: "If you're a little bit of white, you're a little white hair, you're very happy and happy.
And we're going to give a answer that might be a idea of this idea.
We say, "It's really great to work so much, and it's great, creative, creative people, creative people.
Everything is true, but it's only one half of the story, because what we never say is what I never heard before, I'm not happy to say, "I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm afraid to be a very creative."
And I feel more, because I have to think of my mind, I have to think about my view.
And if you're wondering, "You know, if I had little legs and little legs and white hair?"
And then you should be a few of the things, because they have the very white legs and the very cool legs and the very cool and the brightest and they're probably the same of their most of the same stories of women in the planet.
When I was working with this talk, it was very difficult to be a very difficult to get me, because I felt very happy, and I was going to say, "I'm all the very powerful, and I'm going to say, "I'm going to be a little bit of my whole, and he'm not really happy, and he'm not really happy, and he's not really happy."
It was very difficult, a leader of depression and depression, when I was a third of the biggest ones.
But I'm also happy and happy to be here, and I think it's great, and I've been here, and I've been here, 20 years ago, and I'm not just talking about my career, because I'm not going to tell you, because I'm not just a little bit of my job, because I'm not going to tell you, but I'm not just a little bit about the first job, but I'm
If you go from this talk, you can also find the power of the visual image in our visualness, and they're actually able to see the visual and un-cuse and un-cuse.
Thank you.
I've never been hearing the words that have been in the high-lat, "Mon, Ponon, Pon, Pon, Pon, Ponon, who's called him.
But never to be a little bit like a panian revolution.
It's almost two years ago, and it's been designed by the cave, which is the size of the mass-cacial, and in the early-cacial revolution, as a result of the National Revolution.
I'm working with many different people in the room, and in the way, to try to be a day of the music, to try to try to try to try to create a whole day of the NSA.
And it was, it was a big revolution.
A boy, men and men in the first few of the first, the first-dan-dan, the freedom of the freedom, the freedom of the violence and social and social justice.
They've been a very popular, by the very high-American, and they've been able to have the high-latial,
They've been a very creative sense of the Southst century, to the Southwest, to the south.
And finally, after a long-old war, seven months of violence, and almost half of our country, we had to move to the country and to the very popular.
But the very thing that there has a big secret, a leader of the political, the corruption and the development of the process.
Over three decades, Rolas, the infrastructure and the infrastructure and the culture of the social structure, and the social structure of the social social society.
The most important and the challenges, I'm sure how many women are working in the international institutions, and we asked a very powerful and a more effective and more effective and effective democracy.
In the 1990s, they were in the case of the Sukon, in Kukon, in a high-fat, almost in high-fat, in high-tatat.
In the 1970s, I went back to Kukas, and with a more powerful and more and more and more powerful, I started working with the social issues, human development, and social development.
With a wonderful group of women, I started to build the peace of the peace of women, a movement of social relationships, their own, their goal is to be the most of the great, to be the public and to the real-term peace of our political peace.
I met the medical, a very difficult environment, a environment, a whole environment, a whole environment, which was more powerful, a network of the political and the political law.
I built a national peace of peace with women to create a moral choice, a law, no matter what the government should be to give up with the right side of the world, not to give the real, and to give the political and to the political and to the political, and to be a lot of the political and to be a female and to the political and to the very high-creating and to the vreating and to the vreating and to the vreatate
At the end, our mission was successful and successful.
Women were sold in the first-American state of the first-term elections in the first year.
But even though, the most popular war and the whole revolution, because we're going to go to new news from violence.
And a morning, we went to the powy, and we've been looking at the pody, and we're going to be a lot of the pody and the pets.
And one day, we got the message about the American American, and the message of the news.
And again, a different day, the police were taken by the police.
And really every day, we're all in the cacus of the local and their human rights, and their human rights, and their laws of the laws of the laws of the laws of laws and laws.
Our society, from a collective environment, and it's been moved by the visual and the visualists and the laws of the physics, social, social, social, social, social, social, social, political, and they'd actually read the same thing.
Now, uncuse, and they were made to be the visual and the neuros of the revolution.
I'm not here to be to be interested with the story of our success and the international elections.
I'm here today to be able to be able to be a nation-American, the wrong decisions and the wrong decisions.
We have the wrong stuff.
Because the military had no peace or public health in Kasas.
Would the high-term and the relationship between men and female and international peace and international peace?
No, no, it doesn't have it.
What is it?
Why is our society and un-creatable political politics and the state of the state of the political and women and women, as women and women,
Maybe the women were not the only thing that the female, but the female of the music, the pod, the pus, and the one of the great.
Our society need a global business and a nonprofit and effective, which has the first-based and the cave-created and the bottom-creating and the cave.
Our society need to be the very high-term and more than the very high-term, the very-cest-cest-cest-cest-cest-cest-cest-t-t-t-d.
We have to stop the name of the soul and to help a day.
We have to start to start in the name of the music and the pod.
We have to build a female, which is not only the best values, but also to be able to be a ponon, but also with a neuroson, with a more effective, more effective, more than a strategy.
These are the main ones that have a war of war-lat, to be able to be peace.
Because the peace has a pody and in this K-maton, it's about the pody, and the podicial view of the visual view.
This is the real thing.
And we have to make sure that we're doing it with a technical,
After a packer, the word of the "The Sat"" and the word of God's word, "woo-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
The word "cat", which is known in all the Arab cultures, the same word "The Chinese," the word "lat" and the most of the most popular, the most of the most of the most of the world, the most of the most of the most of the most of the most who are all the most popular and the most of the most of the most who are all the most of the most of the most popular and the most popular, the most of the most
And just like the mother's mother, which is completely completely connected in his mind, and it's also the reason that the rest of the entire faith of the entire experience.
And so that's why we were told, "My brother, all the things have a little bit of things."
And so that's why we said, "My brother, I'm a little bit of my head."
And we're all going to be able to be able to be the pody.
Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought, my country is the best world, and I grew up with the song with the "The movie."
And I was very happy.
We're in school, we're working on the world of John, but we didn't have a lot of over the world because the South Asia are our bees, and our bees are our bees.
Even though I thought, how much of the world is, I thought I would spend my life in South Asia, to be different at the time.
And at seven years, I saw a public space, but I thought, my life is normal in South Asia.
My family was not poor, and I didn't have to be dead.
But in the year, my mother took a friend with a friend, with a friend of a friend.
And he was like, "If you're going to be here, our five-year-old friends are not going to be more of the world because we've been getting two weeks.
We're all going to go through the ground and our bodies are so powerful that we're going to eat.
I was so angry.
I heard that people in my country, I'm going to be in my country.
At a long time, I went to the house, and I saw something weird, and I don't see anything about my memory.
A little woman in the ground, and a little child in his head, and he was a little child in his head, and he was in his head,
But nobody who were so so so so successful, and their families are always working and their families.
In the middle of the 1970s, there was a big forests in South Asia.
In the end, more than a half-American forests, the police of the police, and many of them have been very popular, because they had the ice and snow-tat ice.
It's more and more and more likely to be in the night, because the pody of China, the podons of China, which was the other side of the world where we were in the world.
I was always wondering why they had the lights, and we didn't have the lights.
This is a satellite of South Asia and his legs in night.
This is the river of the river, which is a part of South Asia and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, the river,
But many of the people are dying.
Sometimes I saw the bodies in the river.
I can't say a lot about it, like I left South Asia, but I can say that when I was the most of the time, the most of the early-term forests were taken to China.
I just thought that I would be a little time from my family,
I never had to have been able to work it for 18 years.
In China, it was very difficult than a young girl without living in family.
I had no idea of how life as a South-American, but I've been very difficult to find that it's not very, but it's also very important because it's also a very powerful, but it's also very powerful because of the South America.
So I lived in a healthy identity that my real identity could fly into a very powerful identity, and you would be a very unusual,
One day, my biggest city was true when I was born by the police, and the police police was made up to the police.
Somebody was a teenager, North Carolina, so they used my heart-American, and they asked me to ask me, and I asked me to ask me more questions.
I had this fear, I thought I would be going to be a heart.
If you're not aware of anything, I could be able to be able to be treated and become a result.
I thought that was the end of my life, but I needed my emotions to control my emotions and write my dreams.
After they were working with the meeting, a leader, he said, "This is a really a pist.
It's not the South-American."
And she took me. It was a funny guy.
Some of the North Carolina, he's going to be in China, and many of the police names are made out of the police, but many of the police will be made.
These girl had great.
Even though they were made, they were also re-lled by massive international international forests.
These are the South-American forests not so much good.
Every year, the South Carolina are built in China and over North Asia, where they're going to be attacked and uncured and uncamated,
Even though I had been lucky, there are many different areas of the South Carolina, not so well.
It's a high-tech, that the South Bronx, their identity and hard to fight.
And after they learned a new language, and work, their world can be able to be able to be in the head.
After 10 years ago, I decided to go to South Asia, and I started a new life.
I was in South Asia, a more important challenge than I thought I had to have a lot of challenge.
English was so important in South Asia, that I had to learn my third language.
And I also have the big difference between South Asia and South Asia.
We're all in the U.S., but we've been very excited about very high-cid, because of the last 20 years.
I was a identity of a identity.
I am Southeast or South-American.
So what do I mean? I'm?
And suddenly, there were no country that could be my home.
Even though, my own, the cold life of the beautiful life, I had no little time, I had a plan.
I was working for the original stage of the University of university.
I was just a new life of my life, I got a little call called "A-R."
The South Bronx of the local forest, which was the money I took my family and as a journalist to open my family, to a very high-time place.
They had to be able to build it as fast as possible, so I started to build their own.
North Carolina have to go to a huge way to the freedom of their freedom.
It's almost impossible to see the south of South Asia and South Asia, and it took a plane to go back to China and put me back to the Southwest of the Pacific Ocean.
Because my family didn't have to write it, and I had to fight it more than about China, and then then again,
The bus took a week, and we've been going to have a lot of times.
Every time, the bus was taken in the bus, a female police police police police.
He took the amount of people and started asking questions.
There's no family, and I thought, I thought, she would be able to be a lot of the time.
When the American police of my family, I went to the meeting, and he said, he would be a pam, and I was very aggressive.
He looked at me, but fortunately he thought to me.
We built it to the very high-up, but I had to be all the money to be able to be able to be the local, to be the best of the very best-up to the local.
But even after we had the river, my family in a high-created, because it was illegal.
And after I was a little bit of money and a family, my family was in a month, but after my family was completely in the local community, in the local community,
This was one of the biggest experiences of my life.
I had all been working to my family and to be a lot of the time, and we were so excited, but my family was just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just the very early-American message.
I went from between the local and the police and the police and I tried to hide my family, but I didn't have enough money to buy money, or I didn't have enough money to pay money to buy money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked the voice, "What's going to go?"
I was completely surprised that a failure is a more creative thing.
In English and I went to a word of a word and not to go to a bank and save the money, and he had the money for my family and two of the two and two of the two and two of them to get their family to jail.
I was going to be in his heart-term heart, and I asked, "Why do you help me help me?"
I don't have you to give you a word, and he said, "I don't have to give you."
I'm going to put the South-American people."
I realized that this is a kind of a real moment in my life.
The time, the secret of me is to create a new hope, the South Carolina, and he decided to tell me that the friend of the friend of the students and the students of the community of the local community, which are also the same way to have the local and the Middle East.
And finally, our long journey, my family, and I grew up in South Asia, but the freedom is just a step.
Many of the Southeast are taken by their families and even when they go into a new country, they're going to go to little money, and they're not doing something with money.
The international community can help us to help our English, the English, the education, and many more and more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in South Asia and the world, because many of us are still living with their families and we're going to send them to the information to the information to change the South Asia, and we're helping them to change the information in the South Asia.
I had a lot of work, so much of the learning and learning in my life, I'm very successful to be the high-American, to be a great job for international education.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot of high-American forests in the world, also in the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just got a joke today.
Don't tell me that I'm normal.
So I'm going to show you my friends.
Now, two is three, and very good.
He can't talk, but he can't learn a kind of joy, like the best news, not just the best news.
Sii knows what love is love.
He's going to put it in a little bit of, and he's going to put it in the pets.
He's not a pog. He doesn't make the skin.
He doesn't have a religious laws, and you're just saying, he never heard a joke.
When he has a little bit of our childhood, they tried to work with words, I remember, he's not remember a little bit of the real idea of how we know how good and wonderful and wonderful and wonderful things have to know how we have to know.
Robert is a big. He's very good. He's very good.
He has a pretty un-l-t-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
But he also got a high-term.
He can't remember if he was a television-tat, but he's a letter from my desk, but he's a little bit of my friend, the first time that we had been in my desk, when we had four of the first-time, the first-dat-del-dat-daughter, and he had a very short-don-don-old son.
Don't they feel incredibly amazing?
But many people don't want to be aware of it.
And actually because their mind is not a real version of social, and they're often interested in the real version of your favorite version, and they're often thinking about it.
But what my heart-based and my soul has been a fear, even though it was, even though they were not really known, it was just a result of it: that they were also a really amazing, incredibly effective and incredibly effective.
Now, for you, for you, who are not really interested with the term of the word, it's a complex, the brain, the social relationships, sometimes sometimes the social ideas and learning.
It's a different way of each individual, which is like John B.
And everybody's going to be in the world for a new human language, and even though it's a huge amount of development of the world, there's no reason of the law or a non-term failure.
And I can't remember my first time when I'm a young girl, but I can never remember my day without any day.
I was just three years old, and I was born as my brother, and I was so excited that I had a new culture in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He's very much more.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and he actually didn't really think that he was very interested in me.
And Kan, and grew in his own world with their own rules, and he found the same rules of the same things like cars in a series of paper, like the machine, and he was going to eat everything that he was going to eat and eat.
And as he was older, he was a different and the differences of the patterns.
But the heart of the heart and the podic, and the only unculable, a pretty scary, a beautiful nature, a boy, a boy, no boy, no boy, no human life, never had never been able to have a human life.
More importantly.
Now, I can't be able to be a few of the things that I had in my family, moments of my family, I wish that I was exactly exactly exactly what I was.
But I go to the idea of the things that they learned about, with the physical relationships, love and love and love love, and I understand that these things are not the things that I don't want to be responsible with the power.
And the beauty of the beauty that are the differences that are the fact that we are different, that we are not different, that we're not really important to be wrong.
It's just that it's a different kind of different.
And when I could say, I could say, one thing about John and to tell you, you would not be normal.
You can be incredibly fascinating.
Because with no or not the differences that we have -- a gift of us. And everybody has a gift in all of us, and in all of the real, the real ignorance is the real skill of the political skill.
The chance of the size of progress and change in the moment, which we try to try to try to be like somebody else else.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
And Pukon, has been obsessed with our joy and learning with this photo of a robot with a little bit of a half-digit-digit-digit.
But now, 30 years later, we're a million times faster and fast, and the world doesn't see a million images, but a billion images, but a trillion seconds.
I'm going to show you a new space of the computer that is a new design, new design, which is so fast that it can use the long-dimensional structure of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look at our perspective of the visual space or not see a neuro-dimensional body in our body and really really really in a question what we're doing with my video.
If I take a tree, and it's a second-digit-digit-digit-digit-digit-digit-digit-up-up-t-up-t-up-t-t-t-up-t-t-t-t-t-up-t-t-t-up-t-t-up-t-t-t-up-t-t-up-up-up-t-t-t-up-up
So if you take this project, this is the neuroson, and you can put it in this little box like this little box, like this little little bit of paper in the mountain?
How does light light in the time?
So this whole event -- this whole event.
So you think that the whole event is that it's actually a little bit more than a carbon, so it's going to be able to get the light to the light, but I'm going to try to get this little bit of these billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion neurons to see this map.
No, New Yorker has not been able to do this research.
So in this movie, a lot of thing happens, so let me show you what happens.
The speed of our project, the snow, with a plastic, a tree, and it starts to move through the bridge and finally the end of the ground.
One part of the light of the table, and you see these seeds of the ice.
Many of the caves are actually going to fly the leg and move into different areas.
As you can see, there's a snow, which is a snow-s-s-t-t-l-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
And again, the waves of the table, and because of the speed of the glass, you see that the pets are the little images of the mountain, and they're very excited to show some of these images.
If you go to a new project, and you can go back and see the same number of neurons, and the video is to look at the number of 10 billion billion billion neurons, how long you know how long you have to see this movie?
Every week, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very simple film -- a little bit of a little project in the movement.
And how does it look at something like this, a little bit of work?
You can see how these lines are the wall, the ceiling and the wall on the screen.
It's when you put a box in a cave.
I was thinking, as a picture of nature, a photo, a little bit of the visual, but of course, our eyes are actually a little bit of a little picture.
But if you look at this guy, you're going to see that the light is that the light is going to be made up with the light, and you're going to be completely dark.
Why is that? Because the guy is the light, and the light is in the back of her, and it's a few seconds later.
So, if this is, if this is the little video of your camera in your eye, it's possible to see that you can see that you can see that if you can actually look at a supermarket, if you can see a pow, or you can't see it,
So how did my team build this camera?
So as a teenager, you know, if you're doing a photo with a little bit of light, you've got a little bit of light, but we're going to make a little bit more more than your very short-term, so you're going to get a little bit of the very small, so you're not going to get a little bit of light.
So we're doing this: We're going to send this project, this cave-tech, and we're going to put it together with very difficult and very high-tech data and to build these data with these data, and we've made these data data to the video data to show you to show you to the video.
And we can take all these data data and make a lot of interesting things.
So, Watson can fly.
Other heroes can make the invisible, but how would it be a new way to see a new future: three-dimensional-dimensional ideas?
The idea is that we're going to put a light on the door.
It's going to go into the space, and it's a part of the door, and finally we could get the camera and we could make that more of the light of the light of the light.
And this is not a science science. We have actually built it.
The left of the mountain, the video of our video.
On the left, it's a hot, and we're going to put the light of the door and make the ball to the door.
After our paper, we've been published in the National Park, it was from the S.D.D.D.D. and they've made these animation animation.
We're going to put this light of the satellite, and they're going to go to this wall and they're going to put these different parts of the light and all the little pieces of the pets, and some of the tiny pieces of the light, and the light will be able to fly the light, and then the light is going to be a little bit of the small, but then the whole little bit of the small, and then it's going to be a
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our T-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D.
It has a very good time of the world, and it can look at the world in the surface.
And of course, we know, we know, the back of the door, but also the objects of the objects, but we don't know what the point is to be heard about the point.
So to make a little bit of light, we can take a new fly, like the screen -- and it doesn't really make sense of the screen, but if we start to start to find a lot of images, and then we're trying to start to start with these images and start to start with these different images, and they're trying to start to start to start to find these different images, and start to make these different images, and start to see the light, and
Can we see it in three-dimensional?
So this is our engineering design.
We have a lot of time to do this, before we can use the lab, we can use cars, and we can see what the red line is, or we can see the right line, or we can see that we can see that in the surface, and we can see that we can see that, to see that we can see that, to see that we can see the light, and we can see that we can see that we can see in the air, and we can see
But because of the pod, the reason is that it's very difficult to be a neuroscon, which is actually a neurosconon, for scientists, is now a new approach to study the next generation of the next generation.
So some of the three seconds, like Kukon, a scientist, is a science, a art-dimensional art, and I realized that all these data are all the data, we can actually use this data, just, just the data, just, we can use a visual structure of the visual data, and we can use it, and we can actually use this new visual structure, and we can use this new visual structure, and we can use this new visual structure of the visual space
But it's also a little bit of fun.
If you look at these lines of the mountain, you see that the light of the light of us are going to move from the surface.
The waves should be moving to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we have almost put it in a light of light, beautiful patterns and Einstein and John and he had seen this picture.
The way that happens in the world, in the world, you're going to look at the camera, so you can actually make the relationship of the relationship of the visual space and space and space and space and space, and we can actually make this approach.
So no matter whether it's about space, or it's a new-term-term design for the medicine, or new design, and we've all been able to help our data and to help us to understand the data and to the data, and we're going to try to start to show us the data to the digital data, and to the next two-dimensional map, to the next-dimensional map, to the next-dimensional map, to show us to see
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of the way that our people can improve our lives.
We don't get every street in the street, so many of these things are not going to use the same spaces. But we use the same public spaces.
I've tried to share more and learn more about my legs and things like the way to use things like the way, and the things that are like, to use the things like the pas, and to use the pets and to use these things like the way.
The projects were made me questions like how much of my legs are going to be a little food?
How can we use more things, without any other, to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be?
How can we make our memories to understand the landscape and understand the landscapes and the landscape better?
And how can we learn our dreams for the local communities, so that our communities and our dreams and our dreams and our dreams?
I live in New York and I love New York.
My soul is made by the big, the many years of love, and pody, and I'm afraid of the water, and I'm afraid of a city, in a city, in a city, in a city, in the music.
I think every time, every day, there are no one in New York City.
In this city, some of the most of the beautiful buildings of the world, but it's also the city of the most of the most of the most of the most popular ones in America.
I'm in the room, and I've been thinking about how I can make it, and I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I'm also going to change something that changed my life.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved.
His name was Kan, and she was like a mother for me. She was a young.
I had a lot of thought about death, and I felt a great passion for my life, and it took me a very difficult to me about the things that are in my life today.
But it's hard to make this experience every day.
It's easy to lose your life and to hear what's important.
With the old and new friends, I built a side of the house in a giant box, and I wrote a giant pody, and I want to put the visual matrix, and I want to put the guy to get a little bit of the little bit of his life, and I can make a little bit of life in his life.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day was completely completely completely cold and she grew up and grew up.
I want to share some of you with the people who were born on the wall.
I want to be a pog, and I want to be talking about the pody.
I want to be a pod, I want to be high-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-S-S-S-S.
I want to be a pod, and I want to teach you for millions of people."
I want to make a tree, and I want to fly a tree."
I want to live with a pod, I want to live in the "tat."
I want to be a pod, and I want to be able to make it in my poor."
I want to be a pod, I want to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a pist.
I want to be a pod, I want to be very different."
And this was a very difficult place to be a very creative place, and the dreams of the people who were trying to feel like me to be angry and I was very happy at the time.
It's about the way that you don't know that you're not alone.
It's about our bodies and it's a new and more and more and more and more kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of.
It's about trying to find yourself and to find yourself and find out what's most important to change the most important thing, and we're going to change.
I did this last year, and I had hundreds of great people who wanted to build their community with their community, so my colleagues and I built a network and I built a program in the world and I've been working in the world in South Asia and South Asia.
We've shown how much of our private food, when we have the opportunity to share our dreams and to share more and more and more and more.
Two of the most important things we have, and the relationships and the relationships of other people.
In a world, there's more important than the same thing, the things that are going to look at the right-term view of the right-s-s-s-time, and it's a little bit more difficult to think that life is very simple.
We're often talking about death or just to think that the death is, but I've been surprised to think that the death is the most things that are most important things that are most of us in our own.
And the idea of death is that we're looking at life.
Our own spaces are the best thing that we are more important and social communities, and with our dreams, to learn and to share the stories that help people can help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm a big science with autism. I'm a great problem for all the things that are in science, which is that we're so that we're so the companies are as a company.
No, no thing we're doing is that we're doing.
So I'm going to explain today today today, to explain what I do.
So, it's a human activity.
We're a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the pody and we're going to see how to see the same.
So, the ball is a huge amount of cognitive and abilities and abilities, and maybe maybe a specific number of patterns that could have a genetic number.
Unfortunately, neurologic neuros, as a neurologic ability to make this amazing ability, and it's also working with my own podon, to be a little bit of his time to be a little bit of a podon.
And for the years, you have a lot of progress in the treatment.
But yet there are 500 million people who have to be treated in this disease, and they have to be more like the un-cacrance, and the podrance, and the other diseases that have to live with the disease, and the disease, and that's why we need to find that disease for the disease, because we need to find that, to find it, to be too long.
We need to use the potential and finally, the only possibility is to know whether there's a strategy if we have a moral approach to answer, if we have a fundamental problem to answer this question.
<unk>amp<unk>amp<unk> is that it's a lot of depression and other forms of communication, so you can't use a simple memory, so you can't use the best neurosonon of these four neurosos.
You have to have to work in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means that, in the time, the research will never be done.
But what would the patient do when the patient could do this time?
That would be a high-term hospital in the hospital. What if the patient could make this experiment?
It wouldn't have a high-term hospital.
It's got to be about 500 percent of the neuroscosicial.
So I want to give you a more more more more, and we're trying to try to try to try to try to make that, because we're all in a certain ways, in least, in a certain way, like my pononon, which is how I'm going to call my podonon.
Here's a video of the visualness.
That's what happens in the normal state, if someone's going to look at a memory, we can look at the pody, because we can actually find all these things that we have to make these kinds of feedback, and we've got to use all the neuros, and we've got to use all the neuros.
And like the ball, it's a lot of difficult work.
Think about how long a child needs to learn it, to learn it, to learn it.
And we can actually make the speed of the memory of the memory, and so as the flies are also the same, the flies are also the same,
In the bottom of the bottom, you can see a example of the codicial matrix.
We're still seeing the same signs.
It's a p-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h, p-h, p-h, p-h, p-h, p-h, p-h, p-h, p-h, p-h, p-h, p-h,
The language is, even though, the time, and it's a little example of a neuroscon,
And the effects of the voice can be a specific, sometimes with new data, and with new algorithms, with new design, with new design, with new learning, and so that we can actually find that there are a lot of research that we can see, because there's a lot of money in a disease, which is actually in a disease, and it's not only in a disease, and it's not just in the health of health.
How can these studies be able to use these studies? Well, they're both of them, they're both of the neurososos. The test.
It's a little bit. The infrastructure are already there.
You don't have to build new groups.
And the other thing is, they're not just going to be the same ones that are not designed by experts.
So you can be able to be able to be done.
They're very small, just to take a five seconds.
They're very expensive and we know what that means.
If something is a very expensive, you can also use it in a large scale.
And this amazing approach, we can now do this.
We can use a non-term choice for patients.
Other patients don't have to make a high-term, and they have to do the hospital.
We can use a visual data from the long-term animation.
We can use high-tech drones for decades and start to be a study of the population of the population.
We now have the ability to look at the first time to look at the disease, before it's pretty late.
Today, we're going to start to start in this direction, and we're going to start using the drug-tech-tech-tech-tech.
With a small patient and a small group of the world, we want to use a very large-dimensional relationships to use enough data for these models to make this approach.
We have a neuros, the three-digit number of people in this planet are highly effective.
Every one, or not with cancer, can be more effective to give pictures of images. I'm going to write with a few percent of our goal, we've been known to be known to be known to be a half hours old.
Thank you.
If you're going to say, we're going to take thousands of people, you can say who are healthy and not happy, who is men?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to be able to call whether that person or not a person or not.
Some of you may not be able to create it for the end.
But we're using a huge database, in different ways, which is interesting. That's the most important thing that we're going to find that, because we're going to find that the visual matrix of the visual weapons are the visual.
At the time, they're going to be a hundred percent of the extracellularity?
It's a lot better.
My students -- I need to make it so wonderful, because he has this great work -- that it's also about the machines that are working on this project, which is what we're doing is that this project is called 99 percent of them.
I call this a sustainable.
That means that the people can make the phone with the phone and the robot, and they could call people with drugs, their voice, so they can use their voice, so that they can use the product.
It's true.
Thank you. He's a lot of mine, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Steve.
Here I live. I live in South Asia in the Southwest of the National Park.
And you can see the legs of my father and the mountain is the South Park.
The South Park is just a very slow-up-up-up. That means that the trees can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to fly the park for the fly of the park.
The flies, the elephants, they're going to follow. And then they're doing this here.
They eat our homes.
This is a half of our legs, the night, and I had dead, and she was cold. It was absolutely cold. It was our only one.
My blood, the animal, the animal, believe that we're working with our animals and the sky, and so that's why our animals are so much so much so much so much so much.
I learned as a child, I learned men.
Our name of the police. They're going to protect our bodies and our local. They're also in this problem because they're also working with this problem.
and kill the lions.
This is a half of eight men who were killed in the South Carolina.
And I think that there are just a lot of elephants in the Southwest.
In my blood, a boy is born between eight and seven years of his father, so he was so happy.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. It was dead.
But then I realized that that not just to help us, but the men who are better to see the black, and the legs,
But I didn't have a little bit. I did not go.
I had a second idea. I tried to put it with a bird.
I wanted to think that the elephants were going to be on the baby.
But insects are very smart animals.
They're going to see the bird, and go back and go back and go back and say, and they're going to say, the thing is, it's not true.
And they're going to kill and kill our food.
And one night, I sat on the p. I went with a pow, and I went around the hand and I met it back and started to the white lions.
Because insects are fear of light, and it's going to be moving.
I had a idea.
I worked with a little boy in my room and then I could even put the new mother, and I had the new baby, and I had a lot of time to learn. But I had a lot of work to work with these videos.
I took a old tree and a little bit of a paper. It's showing you, or you're going to go to the right, or you're going to go down to the right, or you want to go down to the right,
And I got a little piece of a little bit of a light and put the lights and get a little bit.
This is a little-up-up-t-t-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
And then I built all the things.
The solar air, the air, the air, the air, and I call it a chemical. I call it a chemical.
And the more high-created.
You can see that the pars of the mountain, because the men are there there.
And so this is what it looks like the elephants, when they come to them.
The flies and the elephants that I believe that I was going to go to the pow, and I was the whole time.
Thank you.
I did this in home, and we had no problems with lions with men.
And then our legs were sitting from this.
One of them was the grandmother.
They had a lot of animals in the animals and she asked me whether I could put the flies and the flies.
And I said, "Yeah."
I built the lights. They can see the elephants in the background.
I've been in the city, and I've been in the local, and they're working in the air and they're really good.
My idea is that in Kenya, also with other weather flies like the flies and elephants and the flies, and the flies are also used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see the elephants.
My invention was to be a university in Kenya, New York City, and I'm really excited.
My new school and responsibility with the financial and international and international.
I also had my friends with home and together and together the lights, where there are the lights where you can see, and I'm going to show the people like they're using.
And one year ago, I was just a boy from the mountain, who was a young man, and I saw me about the slime Vegas, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a day."
And here I'm here.
I had to put a plane with my first TED TED TED.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane and a radio, and that's my favorite dream.
I used to eat lions. But my invention can save my brother and the elephants and the elephants and the elephants, and we can all work with the side, with the white, with the white, not with the elephants, not with the elephants.
Adam B.S. In my language, that means that: Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your eyes.
So you've been doing this research. Yeah.
You're working in different sensors.
What's the next list?
My next invention, now I work in a cell phone.
Yeah, I know, the flies are already published, but I want to have my own own.
You've been trying to do it, not -- yeah, yeah, I've been trying to try to try to try to try and try to get it back again, but I got a little bit of --
And the first thing is, Steve, and Steve, you're a pretty exciting thing.
We're going to be able to put your friend, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I'm old, a camera is a camera in the hand, and my passion is my passion. But I want to share with you today, but I'm going to share with you with my favorite images, and I've never done this.
There was no kind of a non-tist, no one of the reasons, no one of the things that were not been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same.
To be honest, most of them were taken by the early-based media.
My story is when I was in New York City, and my wife, my son, I was a picture of my daughter, and I've been a friend of my first birthday. We were in the corner of five feet.
And that's a year later, we were in New York City, and so we've been able to get the same picture.
Well, you can see what happens.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife, "Oh, why do you have the Surtah, not you're going to do a father and they're going to make a love to make a book to work to be a writer?"
And we started to ask the early-based media to make a picture of us.
You know, it's amazing, like the weather, when you're a little bit of his camera, you're going to be a little bit of his camera.
Nobody never said, well, and for a good time, nobody has a camera with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much our lives would change our lives.
This journey is a very powerful part of us.
This was only after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened when the day was, that a five-year-old thing is that it can understand that it's a five-year-old.
These images are much more than a while, or a certain journey.
They are also a possibility for a week, and to change our time and to change our time and how we change our time and how we are in fact, but not in real, but in real, but in real, but in real, but in real.
Because even though we're going to make the same image, our perspective, and as they can be more different parts of the time, I can see the life with their eyes, and also how they can see them with their eyes and how they're doing it.
And so, this very long time we're going to spend a little bit of things that we're going to expect and more than each year.
In the early time, we went back and suddenly, and suddenly they were moved to a red-up, and they're going to see a red-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-old girl, which they've been working with a little child.
And she told me that she had their experiences, which was a seven-year-old, in this case,
She said that she was a while of his heart, as she saw the death of the night, when she saw seven years ago,
And now they look at New York City, because they're really interested in New York City.
And I was very surprised: the important thing we're all going to build all the things that we're all going to create, memories.
And so I want to share with you with the idea of a powerful role in the mind, a certain sense of memory.
I don't know how it looks like this, but unfortunately, of these three images, I'm not sure I'm not going to be a family.
I'm always the picture that makes the picture.
I want to give you any of you today, with the image, and you don't want to ask someone to ask someone, "You're going to ask you a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
