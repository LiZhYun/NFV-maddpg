When I was 11, I was a morning of the sounds of the sound-proof joy.
My father heard on his little, gray radio show at the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual in the time, because the news was mostly depressing.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'm never going to forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban was carrying the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and it's banned girls to go to school.
And so I was paying attention for five years as a boy and I was teaching my older sister who couldn't go alone to a secret school.
Only that's how we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to make sure no one could guess where we went.
We're hidden our books in shopping bags so it looks like we're going to buy a shop.
We've been doing a house where we've been doing 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was so scary, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risk our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then again, the class had to come out for a week, because the Taliban had swallowed.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to leave us?
Did you know where we live?
We were afraid, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family where education was more important and daughters were valued.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign stranger from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send his daughter -- my mom -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
But my mother was born.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement, just to transform our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this is the first one in his family who ever received education.
And it was always clear that his children would have been given education, and his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much greater risk of sending his kids not to school.
I still know that in the late days, I was frustrated with the Taliban, sometimes by our lives, of the unconscious fear and the perspective of ignorance.
I had good love to leave. But my father said, "Told, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be displaced in war in your house.
But one thing that's going to remain you is that what's inside there, and even if we're going to pay your blood supply for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- do you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have a higher degree of college education, and if my family hadn't used so much for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudly unfulventor of the Midbury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was rejected by his family, because he announced to send his daughters to school, one of the first ones who shared me.
He's not just talking to my graduate degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the one who runs him through the car through Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even larger dreams for me.
That's why I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped to create SOLA, and maybe the first department for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls's school workers still are risk.
It's wonderful to see how the students at school have great ambition to see all of them who are given to their own chances.
And see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, and then my parents, despite the end of all the time, and against the end of the day, they're missing.
Like Ahmed. This is not the real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed's the father of a student.
A month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they're the death of a bomb on the street, just for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rings and a voice beat him, if he was sending his daughter back to school, they would try again.
He said, "I'm going to get excited now, if you want to, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter in the game because of your old-time and over-the-time imagination."
In terms of Afghanistan, I've discovered something that's often going to be clear in the West: the back of most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that's clearly your success.
That's not what our mothers are not supposed to play a role in our success.
They're often the ones that are often re-exporting and compelling for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is unaware of the support of men.
The Taliban only went to school for a few hundred girls -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are going to press the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen from America, like that.
Americans recognize how uncertainty these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not the duration and changing with the United States groups.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using for them, they're encouraging, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me and the unconceived possibility, and I remember the girls who visit the SOLA.
Just like I have a big dreams.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, including a living -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977, I'm young, but I'm not -- -- -- -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, projects on the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I think, 21 years, we thought that we're Italian good people, and we've made good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project that inspired my first book, "Ripples of Zambehenhenhenhen, was one of the people we wanted to show in Italy, how food is being built.
We came to the Italian seed in South Africa, in this glowing valley, which leads to Sambesi River, and we taught the local population of the farming in the Italian tomato and the Ccini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they began to come up.
We were surprised that there was no such fertile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."
"Some still in time to save people from Sambia from the rainforest."
Of course, everything wonderful about Africa.
We had this super-end tomato tomato. In Italy, they became the size of the size of Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how just agriculture is."
When the tomato gas rose and red, over the night, there were about 200 pilps from the river and yelly everything.
We said to the gambers, "Oh God, the Filcher!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were Italian-doughy in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French world did, after I saw what they did, I was pretty proudly proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the candle.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense that we don't have the existing African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a herbadian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion Euros in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been taken.
Just read your book.
Call from a African woman who we've been doing.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionalists, and there are only two ways that we deal with people, we colonize them, or we're patriarchical.
Both words come from the Latin root, which means "Vater," means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchical: I keep myself in any other culture, like they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronisis: I keep myself in any other culture, like they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "baria," the boss,
I was delighted when I read the book "Imall's Beautiful" by the "sautiful". He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, then people don't want help, they leave them in peace.
This is the first principle of the help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocololatial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and we invented a system called corporate fund, which never has been launched, but you're never motivated to the service of the local passioner, the servant of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you put them together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We're in cafeteria. We're going to meet in kneipies.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends, and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like this person, what do you want to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important of humanity.
We're helping them to find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why instead of going into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have part of it, and they're never going to say what they want to do with their money, what ways they can see.
Recess has this light-up.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never seem to public meetings.
We work on one to do that, to make a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the hospital worker who is the company who's in the business room with you in your house, sitting in your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the tools to transform your passion in a way that transform your life.
I've tried this in vitity, West Australia.
I was preparing time, trying to break the brakes, where we tell others what to do, to escape.
And so I walked through the streets for the first year, and I had my first three days of customers, and I helped him. He was in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen came up and said, "You know, you helped the Maori help us?"
I helped this five fish fish people work together and not selling this wonderful tuna in Albany to 60 cents, but to Japan for Sushi for 15 dollars. And then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped us help us build a factory?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do -- I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I hold the mouth and I hear them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Let's get it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 50,000 companies in the process.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on in loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a professor before he was working with companies. Peter's printer said, planning is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty spirit.
So you build Christchurch, without knowing what the smartest human Christchard wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to do that, to get to you.
You have to offer them discretionion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to come up.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the most cheated presentation you've heard today?
"Callful, passionate people. That's what you've liked.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- the dominant fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal engine is not sustainable.
The open-life world is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, build, transport, and exchange them with them.
The technologies are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it.
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a great story in a futurist magazine a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860s.
In 1860, they came together and they made a little bit of what would happen in the city of New York, and the conclusion was a non-linear conclusion: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows in this pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get their hands, and it would be impossible to get the crap of six million horses.
Because they were already sitting in the crap.
and 1860s, they see the dirty technology that's feeding life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive automotive maker in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology has made the race. There were tiny little factories in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered to them with discretion.
They don't come and they're talking to you.
The next thing you have to do is you have to offer them absolute, passionate and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the largest company, all of which are able to do is to sell three things: to sell the product that needs to be great, the market market, and the financial intelligence system has to be massive.
Have you guess what?
We've never met a single person who can produce something at the same time, selling and selling money to take care of it.
That doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 ivory companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wicehouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have known, only one: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 years of women in Northeast, and we start giving them the lessons to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransonsons's Medicalography, and the job of the 16 years old, it's the first two sides of Richard Brans's brain stimulation, and how often he uses the word "Imheal" and how many times the word "we" is.
Never "I" and 32 times "we"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody built a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small professional background in the cafeteria and the cafes and the bars. Their friends who are going to do for them, what someone has done for this gentleman who's talking about this eagogue. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support companies to help them find the tools and people, and we've found that the wonders of intelligence in the local population can be transformed by the culture and the economy of this community, just by understanding the passion, the power and imagination of their human beings.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how to be, in Alice's miracles.
The Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communications -- to try to share the training of education.
I was afraid.
Fear. Fear of those students with their large brains and their large books and their big, I don't know words.
But when the conversations developed, he took me like Alice, when she was driving down to the pig cancer chicken and saw a door to a completely new world.
And I also felt like I was interviewing the students, and I was amazed by the idea that they had, and I wanted to find that other miracles discovered.
I think it takes to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We really need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy and health and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going on. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-profististist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
I want to show you a few ways to do this, and we can tell you that we can see that science and technology that you're looking at, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, well, and what?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only do you think of their grandchildren, but also tell us that their cheeks, the plastic structure in our bones, is to look at them, because it's important to understand and treat oatosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you're going to have no-through dictionary.
The dictionary is a obstacle to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use the "talk" and time" in time, but why don't you just say "a-space and time," what's much more understanding of us?
And we're going to understand your thoughts, not the same thing that you're going to do to distract your level.
As Einstein said, "Well, things just as simple as possible -- but not easier."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific field without dealing with tradeoffs.
Some things are thought about, examples, stories and analogies, and so you can pull us into your mind.
And if you're putting your work, you're going to take off the dots.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "Ride point?"
What happens when someone's going to stand up? Another one is going to be taken for weeks, and with these dots, you know, your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits too much on the talk-based part of our brain, and that's how we're going to be more excited about it.
This is an example of genesbove Brown's powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the pigmentation is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, simple, simplified sentence that the audience, once it loses the thread, it's using images and graphics that also inform our other senses, and it creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up the door and see the miracle land that science and technology is being replicated.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the <unk>Nerdar in me, I want to connect everything with a equation.
And if you look at your science and you're looking at your dictionary, you're going to share that through the credible, and the audience tells you what's important, and you multiply the whole thing with the passion that you have for your incredible work, and you're going to come up with, and you're going to see, you're going to have some of the incredible interactions that are all about new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really sorry.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can write a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can upload it in sound cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Berlin in 1996, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in the time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going on the street and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're going to think that all these people who were coming in and asking changes, a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone phone?
Hold it up.
Keep your phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines of information.
Plust data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.R. Reission has set up a line.
This is the rule of law enforcement protection.
This line is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in Europe has to store a range of users of users.
Who calls who? Who is sending a email?
Who is sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone, where you're.
All this information is stored for at least six months from your phone company or your Internet phone service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are all up there, and they said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to trade this protective defenses.
We want self-state self-dimensionalism, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want that."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people were going on the streets of Berlin, and they said, "Sisiness rather than fear."
And some people even said that this could be the Dallas 2.0.
The mask was the Grandstader police in East Peru.
And I also wonder if this really works.
Can all this information store all of us?
Every time I use my cell phone, I'm going to use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Declagina Telecomputer company, who was the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please send all the information you've stored over me.
And I asked her once, and she asked her again and she didn't get a right answer. Only hala Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that you're doing the dialysis.
So I decided to put a court of court cases on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said, no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end, it was a comparison to them.
I'm going to take back the tag, which they all demanded to me to send information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court officer decided that the introduction of the E.U. line was the German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.30,000 lines on information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My hand is.
But then I realized, after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you can see where I'm walking in the night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information with the public.
I want to do it published.
Because I want to show people what the protection of protection is.
So with time online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and forth.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I'm going to drive from Frankfurt, with the train to K<unk>l<unk>l, and how many calls I'm going to go.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then I call a few friends, and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up, and you call it, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a design plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who to talk to who to send a email, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said, at the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi knew who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders had been, then maybe this might never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe it wouldn't happen.
And then, not the case of the Ice Hemps.
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so many information, as they can get over us, online and online.
They want to have the ability to track our lives, and they want to store all that in a long term.
But self-determin and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
They have to fight for that every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not an old-fashioned one.
If you go home, you're going to tell your opponents, just because companies and state countries have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to the information they've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your self-state self-state self-time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Immedate shops, rapid restaurants, concrete spaces.
So the city plan is to come up and think about changing the names of South Central, so it's for something else, it's changing it in South Los Angeles, like that changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Immedated stores, rapid restaurants, concrete spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of Drive's Stivehrus and Drive-Dysys.
The great thing is that the Drivehrus kill more people than the Drive-bysys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in infectious diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't really meet that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you had no access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I'm going to find that carpatchers are bought and sold like use carriers.
I see the dialogue centers going on like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I've had a little bit more attention to 45 minutes of life to get an apple that's not equipped with pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call parkwater.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay in.
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, L.A. Green Gries, and we started to plant my food heat, and fruit trees, and plant the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of executive group, together from the gardens of all the social layers and all the city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically put me up a station, and said I have to remove my garden, the station was turned to a popular configuration.
And I thought, "Well, come here, right?
A leader of leadership for growing food from a piece of land that you're completely concerned about?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herds with this."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I spoke to the city department and a member of Green Ground Zero, and they put a petition on the front of Change.org and 900 editors were successful.
We kept the victory in the hands.
My city even called it, and said they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the largest panels in the United States in the community.
They have 67 kilometers of concrete in the field.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell should they not find that OK?
By building a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my body of peace, and I'm telling people they should grow their own food.
To grow their own food is how your own money is to print.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm glad to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Homework is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's been painting the walls, I'm going to get lawns and park plants.
I use the garden, the soil, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my graves for this stuff.
You'd be surprised to see what the ground Earth can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was being a instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the floor.
You might be wondering how kids are influenced by this.
The garden is the therapeutic and the most bold act that you can do, especially in the city.
And you can also get strawberry.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 o'clock in the morning. They were in my backyard, and I came out and I looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason for the road."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that's only what I've empowered to do. People told me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "I'm going, "No, no, I'm afraid you're going to make something.
And that's the case of the road.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back to their health."
And then, at another time, I put a garden in this homeless garden in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the plaster.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced and how they planted with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even though it's only for a moment.
Green Gris has already planted about 20 gardens.
and we had 50 people who came up with our way to the water, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomato, they eat tomato sauce.
But if they're not offered anything about it, if they're not shown how food minds and body, they're eating blindly, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that they're looking for, and that's not going to lead to them.
The gardeners, I see a chance to train these kids to care about their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground floor, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a ship drone container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free stop, because free is not sustainable.
The comry of sustainability is that you have to keep it through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and they're enjoying the joy and the pride and honor when you build their own food, and when you open farmers' markets.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy thing.
I want you to become all the ecological rebels, gangs, gangs, gangs,
We have to turn the image of the vel.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
The gang is going to be a "fugry Shock, you know?
And let that be the gun of your vote.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're sitting in the web chairs and you want to make a meeting where you're talking about making some fun.
If you want to meet me, you come with your knees, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to your garden, and you can plant some shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the whole Oxford dictionary is "nnnolly monaster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nnnolly monaster" means "the altruistic politicians."
Even though a newspaper publisher was given a better definition: "A Snollygid is somebody who's going to be a hospice, regardless of party, program or performance, and success, and success of the pure power of the aristocracy."
I have no idea what the "preatal" is.
Something about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
For example, 1771, for example, according to the U.K. Parliament, newspapers didn't have the exact word of the debutney.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was looking at the parliament.
They threw him in the Tower of London, and they gave him a man, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to stop, and eventually he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the sentence "so" very strong, like Brass." Many believe.
There's a lot of stuff about the English word for the pch.
But that's not true. It's going back to a facilitator of the freedom of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want you to take you to the United States, at the time it's reached independence.
And you've seen the question about how you call George Washington, the state of state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Dutch nation?
and it was a debate that was published in Congress for a long time.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him governor Washington, and others, his highness of George Washington, and then again, the propulsion of the freedom of the people in the United States of America from Washington.
Not such a thing.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that was a failure.
They weren't monarchical, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with this debate, because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the journal book book book that always writes, "I've got the same issue."
The reason for the waiter, and the boredom was that the representation of the house was against the Senate.
The representative house worker didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want him to do it.
King calls, and maybe it may even cause ideas to follow it.
They wanted to give him the most shocking, most miserable, horrifying titles that they could think of.
This is a cover.
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before, but he just meant someone who had a board of directors.
Something like the preference of a jury.
He had no longer the size of the book, or "Creebater."
Sometimes, the president had small colonial and government groups, but it was a really unmanned title.
That's why the Senate refused to leave him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign the agreement and hit foreign carriers.
Who's going to take him seriously when he's got a stupid little title like President of the United States?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't come.
Instead, you're going to have a word that's not meant to use the book "The Prince Of State" in the way, but they really wanted to make sure that they didn't agree with their honest respect for the opinions and institutions and civic nations, whether it's in the Republic of the monarchy, whether it's the state of the state, that the state of the preservation, not the rest of the United States, the rest of the rest, the
You can learn three interesting things about this.
One, and I think that's the best thing -- until now I can't figure out if the Senate has ever demonstrated the name of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has only loved the title. He's waiting for the fact that the Senate is active.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary is -- -- then you're going to wait at 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today, the world's "The Director of America" is not as scary, isn't it?
This has to do with something more than 5,000 nuclear swamps that he has and the largest economy in the world and a drone drone drone drone and all that stuff.
And reality and history has given the title.
And that's how the Senate won the end.
They have a respectional title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the sound of authenticity -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147, 147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear bombheads and so forth.
So at the end of the day, the Senate and the representation of the house, because nobody feels shocked when you're told that you're the president of America's United States today.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'm going to leave you with.
So politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the reality changes more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you very much.
So I got to a Laster with about 50 rustels at the battle of Khlaalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to sit my black-grained gloves against a pair of brown leatherers and a rocket on the government hospital that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I've been big with the war, but next to Pyjama party and football game and playing with the racist and the Southeasts and the Arab League of Brazil and the Brazil's sociology demonstrations that no one who lived with communism and Afghanistan and I've been painting and painting, I knew what that meant before that was happening.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm here, a trained Afghans, Southeast of God Gnadad, aistist and a radicalist artist who has been working on the last nine years in Afghanistan, and created.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainglows. I want to make art that connects to the personality and character and interpret the narrative and re-scange reality and even the way that a kind of visualized peoples are trying to try to understand the world that we're living in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- the jihad that governs its jihad against the community like "Popifum Bling" and used to use violation and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can the jihad first do when they're going to the parliament and they're going to do a choice campaign with the slogan, "Do I choose me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to break this mafiosi that are used as a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rassass," where you're going to be a police station, a false control center on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes from them, giving money to the police department to the police department, and the police of the police department, and they hope they accept us that they take 100 dollars to the road.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the Middle World.
The war and the stranger who came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only catch a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I'm building the bar of indigenous Afghan loveders with a protected and a bunch of recycled metal-towned inner-towned inner-towned environment.
And I'd like to see how a simple slot from Kabul looks like a piplling app between 189999 to create a dialogue about the current development organization in the past- past-century Colombian rhetoric of the White Shomanian man, and maybe even a few civilized man to protect him and even a few civil society.
But for all of these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood, misrepresented.
But I do, because I have to, because the geography of self requires it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, just so.
I feel like I've now built a very uncomfortable tension in the room, because I wouldn't have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I've got something to change.
This is the first time someone is going to come to the TED stage, so you can appreciate that you can see that.
If some women were really excited when I came out, you don't need me to tell me this, I read on Twitter later.
I also find myself, I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in a very short order of 10 seconds, which you think of me.
And that's not everybody who has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're going to all be fired, so you're not doing anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not that I'm hoping to be so embarrassed as this image.
A visual image is powerful, but a image is also superficial.
I've just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never had a friend of mine in fact.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should go out and put my hand into the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrong brine that I used to do two days ago, there are very few ways to change our existence, and our utterness has -- even though it's super-expicial, and it's essential -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless to me is to be honest today.
And I stand on this stage because I'm a model.
I stand on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a winning in the genetic lottery, and a critical legacy, and maybe you ask what that legacy is.
Now, in the last few decades, we have defined beauty not just as healthy and old and symmetrical, where we are programmed biologically, but also as big, brutal, feminine and bright-world.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion assistant said, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smrow. Woman: Woman:
And first, I'm going to comment on your model of knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, all the modules that have been counted on the lengths, each single one that was being dased, and that of 677 panels were only 27 or less than four percent of us didn't know.
The next question that's always going to be asked to me is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And first I say, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become the president of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-American warrior, which would be completely wrong, because you would be the first."
If they still say after this great cross-up, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for nothing, and you could be the editor of American bird bird bird cancer or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M. or the next Steven Meisel.
To say, you want to be a model later, that's like you're going to say that you want to win the Jack Prize in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of simulated model of knowledge, because it's different than the heart surgeon's brain surgery, it can only be expanding.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is just like a nice flap, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a photo to run," now, the leg first, and long, this arm goes back to the back, this arm, the head is all about three feet, and you just start to see how you're going back to the foot, and you're going back to 300, 400, you're going back to the time,
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less odd than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what's happened there.
If you finish school and you've done a few jobs, and you can't say a lot more, and you're going to say, well, if you want to be the president of the United States, but you're in the room, "10 years of underwear." You're looking at a strange thing.
The next question that I'm often asked is, "Who is going to bring all the photos?"
And yes, this is pretty much all the photos that are being stored, but this is just a small part of what's happening.
This is the very first photo I did, and that was the very first time I carried a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months ago, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this film.
My friend had to come up with me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a magazine for French bird bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They're building, and they're building a group of professionals, from Hairstylusists and remixers and photographers and Shirley and Stylists and all their assistant and the publishers and the development. They're building. This is not me.
Okay, the next thing that people always ask me is, "Well, did you have things for free?"
Yeah, I have too many 20-m-m-m-mafy gloves that I can never wear, except the things I get free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was walking across a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took a saying, "Excuse me, Mr. King Cup," and we could go on.
I've got these low-cost things about my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who are paying for their appearance and not because of their personality, they pay a high price.
I live in New York, and I've been through the 140,000 teenagers who have been stopped and filtered in the last year, 85 percent black and Latino and most young men.
It's only in New York, only 177,000 young black and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Am I stopped?
But, how often do I leave? When I'm stopped?
And I found myself in this talk, that 53 percent of all the women in the United States don't like their bodies, and this number is going up to 78 percent when they've become 17 percent.
The last question I've been asking is, "How is it a model?"
And I think you're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and glowing hair, you feel very happy and scary."
And backup, we're going to give a answer that might be given this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, what I never said before the camera is, "I feel unconscious."
And I feel unconscious, because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I going to be happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some of the modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most coolest crabs, and they're the ones that probably most uncertain women on the planet.
When I've been preparing this talk, it seems very difficult to me to move a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable, and I felt like, "I got all the benefits from a stack that I've been attracted to my favor." And it doesn't feel very good at the other hand, and that's not always going to me."
It was very difficult to really close a legacy of oppression because of gender and race, if I'm one of the largest buyers of it.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done here before 10 or 30 years or 30 years ago, my career has been completely, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I't pay college, which is so important.
If you take something out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our ugly and failure rather.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who have come to life in exilation: "Son, paddafi resistance. Beauty.
But I'm never going to be something like a gaddafi revolution."
It's now nearly two years since the Harby Revolution has been formed by the waves of mass mass mass mass destruction and both in the Tunisian revolution.
I connected with many other Libyers, inside and outside of Elyens to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gadry.
And she was there, a big revolution.
Boy, Gayby women and men stood in the first row, the end of the regime, the Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They have shown an explicit courage by putting on the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east, across the west, until the south.
After the end of the time, after six months of brutally brutal war and nearly 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and to remove the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a great servant, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation of the trajectory.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannic regime and infrastructure both, and also the culture and the moral structure of the ly-bic society.
The devastation and the challenges, I was ignoring how many other women have come back to rebuild the civil society of Lya, and we asked a policy and a legal transition to democracy and national act.
and at least 200 organizations were founded during the same time and immediate time after Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exil, I came back to Lybia, and I began to develop a unique enthusiasm, and I started to organize the issues of art, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding community of Elyan Women, a movement of women, leaders of various life forms, whose goal is to be able to come to public education for the sociological architecture of women, and to our right to the right to the right, to the act of leadership and peace culture.
In the general election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was also polarized, a community that was shaped by the selfishist politics of dominance and purpose.
I led a mission of peacebuilding, Elyenans, to achieve a policy rule, a law that any citizen should not be asking the right, the right to vote, and to be in charge of political parties, and mainly to a male and female and female-scale, and to try to bring a clear-scale and to the bottom-up line of the line.
And at the end, our initiative has been taken over and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the state legislative elections in the first 200 years since 200 years.
But very quickly, the euphorism of elections and the entire revolution, because every day we started to think about new messages about violence.
We went to the news of the year and we went to the news about the Dutch mosques and Sufi leaders.
On another morning, we received messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then again, another morning, the suicide bombers were signed by the army.
And really every day, we're going to be at the rule of the milests and their ongoing practices against the human rights of the prisoner and their neglect of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind, polarized and distant from the ideals and principles, liberty, dignity, social justice, which they had at the beginning.
Intusion, and denial, and the lum became the icon of the magazine.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our pressing and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to tell you that, as a nation, the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We put our priorities wrong.
Because elections didn't bring peace or stability in Lybia.
Did the real-world and the change between female and male officials peace and national acumen?
No, it doesn't have it.
What is it then?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate the political politics of dominance and the end of men and women and women?
Maybe the women weren't the only ones that were missing, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the un-cistess.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus to be more than it took the elections that ultimately strengthening the polarization and the fragmentation.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it takes the numerical, quantitative, the embodiment of the female.
We have to stop the name of anger and ask a day of the revenge.
We have to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We have to develop a female discourse that doesn't only blame the next values, but also it also involves, and it's also that the problem is that, in fact, the way that the revenge is, cooperation, not a competition, rather than a tradeoff.
These are the ideals that need one of the things that we need from war to war to achieve peace.
Because the peace has a alchemia, and in this alchemia, it's about the causal and masking viewings.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do this in general, before we do it in sociological.
After a verse from the Koran "Salamam" -- peace -- "The word of the good god, rawled."
The word "Leinemem" again, which is known in all the abedham traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "inach of "ince" and symbolized the maternal feminine, the whole life of humanity, the man and the female and the female, all the tribes and all the tribes,
And just like the mother's heart of the embryo growing in him, it's so much surrounding the ground of the compassion's existence.
And that's why I said, "My Gnade is all things."
And that's why I said, "My Gnade has given me to my Groll."
I think that all the world's going to be saved to the gahade.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were putting the history of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until the change of anything.
At seven years, I first saw a public interface, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to have no hunger whatsoever.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from the sister of a colleague.
And he said, "If you're going to this, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore, because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're stuck in the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're dying soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people were suffering in my country.
And I was walking on the board for a moment, and I saw something horrible that I couldn't delete from my memory.
A black woman was in the ground, and a car-in-fipped child in her arm is shining helplessly helplessly in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because they were all engaged in doing that, to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-1990s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were blind to the victims, and many more of them survived because they ate grass, and beetles and tree cortex.
Lights have become more and more and more and more likely to get me out of the night, except the lights of China on the other side of the fish that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we don't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and neighbors on night.
This is the river of the Ivory, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very much of its way, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of die.
Sometimes I saw bodies going into the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine was sent to China.
I just thought I would be separated for a short time from my family.
I never thought it took 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea what life would be like as the Northstorean refugee, but soon I learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in silence that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back into a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police police police and sent to the police department.
Somebody was paying attention to being a North Bronx, so they tested my Chinese records and asked me a lot of questions.
I was so afraid of this fear, and I thought my heart would explode.
If there's anything unnatural, I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought this would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the questions, a lawyer said to the other, "That was a false statement.
She's not a North Korean lady."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are taking messages from foreign messages called iyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police police and they are released.
These girls had great fortune.
Even though they got caught, they finally released out of massive international printing pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are released to North Korea, where they are tortured, or they are being executed or they're being executed in public.
Although I was lucky enough to escape, there's not a lot of South Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard for survival.
After they've learned a new language and they've found work, their world can be put on a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was leaving myself in Southern Korea, a bigger challenge, when I thought I had thought.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I also have seen the difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very different from ourselves, because of 67 years of the project.
I was walking through a identity crisis.
Am I South or North Korean?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the adaptation to the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show of the university.
Just when I was more successful in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Bronx authorities started to take the money I was sending my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to be moved around, to a remote place in the country.
They had to be able to fly as quickly as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, and ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made my way back to the northwest border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run it on more than 2,000 miles through China and then to South Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we've almost caught several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese officer promised my family, I decided to be determined, and he said she was a drunker, and I was her lock.
He looked at me in a wobble, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to go to the low-datical border, but I had to almost go to the store of all my money to really get the border control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After having paid money sentence and paid money, my family was released within a month, but shortly, my family was replicated again in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the largest distractions of my life.
I've done everything I could to protect my family to freedom, and we've been so close to it, but my family has just been arrested just before the south Korean Embassy.
I went and I went from the Department of Defense and the police department, trying to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back to cash and money money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man said, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised that a stranger is concerned about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without being able to shoot a bank machine, and he paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Bronx people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger that I've ever described is a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the friend of strangers and support of international community as the hope of the North Koreans.
After all, after our long journey, my family and I were back together in South Korea, but the freedom of freedom is just a step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they come into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family workers, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from the inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would like to have the hope of supporting North Koreans with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Koreans around the world, and you're going to see on the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just got a request today.
Please not tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to divide them in unconditional, and he's going to share them in a way that they're not.
It's not a stupid thing. It doesn't look at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he's never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to think of words that I don't even remember, he's reminded me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful we have to be the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has an absolutely un-matable memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate sword, but he remembers the publication year from every song on my iPod, talking when he was four, while the first episode of the tekebugies on my arm and the M Lady brothers's birthday.
Don't you listen to it, you know?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds are not in the social version of normal, they're often understood and wrong.
But what my heart encourages and my soul was that although that was the case, although they weren't seen as usual, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic, and unusual.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex disorder in the brain that affect social communication and learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a different thing that's happening in every single individual, and it's called Remi, like Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes of autism is found in a new person, and although it's one of the fastest growing interventions in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm sitting in autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very upset.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me.
Remi lived and re-inited in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like driving cars in a row to eat the washing machine and eat everything that came under it.
And when he got older, he became different and the differences became visible.
But behind the ravination and the hustidity and the end of hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being who had never been lied.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of times I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
The normality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only tell one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or non-religist, the differences we have -- we have a gift. Everybody of us has a gift in it. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment that we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edredon has filled with us with awe and curiosity, and this photo on a project, a apple is leaking through and a waste-long period of destruction.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and the world doesn't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femtoto-Multure photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create timel images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that are looking at the outside of our view, or without an <unk>-ray image in our body and actually ask what we mean with "Damera" with the screen.
Now, if I take a laser axle and I turn it into a billionth second -- these are several-seconds -- I'm going to make a package of photons that's barely a millimeter, and this photon pack, this is a project, and this is going to move into light, and I'm going to say, like a million times faster than a second, than a second project.
So, if you take this project, this photons pack and you shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What is light in the slow motion?
So this whole event -- -- this whole event.
So, think about this event, actually, it takes less than a nanototore -- so long as the light takes to go back this lane -- but I'm going to try to get this video about 10 billion to see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, this is a very big thing that's going on in this movie, so let me analyze this and show you what's going on.
The pulse, our project, is going into the bottle with a photon pack that starts to move through and then breaks inside.
And part of the light is coming out of the table outside, and you see that distribution of waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the elevator and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that's going around the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the screen, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images at the end of the bottle.
Now, if you take a normal project and let it back the same route, and the video will slow down at the order of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring movie -- -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a still-time photographer?
You can see again, these waves of the table, the Tomets and the wall on the background, you can see how the wall is flashing.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
And it seemed like the nature of this photograph was painting a photo, each of the things that you see, but of course our eye is a set of images.
But if you look at this Tom's Tom's, you'll see that when the light is suspended, it's going to keep going to be dark.
Why is this? Because the Tom's coming up and the light is going around in it and comes back to a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto-Mamera is built in your Camerahandandy, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if a fruit is a fruit, without touching it.
So how did my team built this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo of temporary airtime, you have very little light, but we better use a billion times faster than your shortest waste period, so you're not getting any light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photo pack of photons, a million times, and then we're drawing this again and then you're going to combine this very clever synchronization, and we're combining this gigabytes of data, and we're going to create this pemto video, and we've shown you.
And we can take all of these raw data, and make very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superhero: can you see corners?
The idea is that we're going to crawl a little bit of light on the door.
It's going to be interrupted, and it's going to be a part of it, and it's going to be reflected back to the door, and eventually we could go back to the camera, and we could use that more and more of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femtoto camera.
Behind the wall, a puppet is hidden, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the International Communications System, it was taken by Nature.com, and they've created this animation.
We're going to take this light project and we're going to put it back into this wall, and this photonsuit is being turned into all directions, and some of the photons are going to reach our hidden soup that will actually break the light back, and then then the door will reflect a part of the light and a tiny bit of the photons will come back to the surface, but they'll come back to the very slightly closer to a camera at the very close
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femtoto camera has some unique skill.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at light speed.
And of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is about which distance is.
By making a laser light of a laser, we can take a raw image that -- as you can see on the screen -- not really make sense, but if we take many of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light-through-up, we can see the object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a lot of stuff to do before we can make this happen in the lab, we could build cars that avoid collisions and recognize what's on the curve, or we can look for dangerous vessels by looking at light that we're looking at through open windows, or we can build endoads that see the body around the river and the Okchard.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is a very challenging, which is really a web call for scientists, now, thinking about Femtoto photography, because a new visual animation process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edredon, even a scientist, even a science has become a art of the ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data that we collect every time, not only the science processing process, but we can create a new form of computer photography, and the color, and the light, we can only look at that wave between the time, and we can't look at that wave of time, and we're looking at all
But it's also a little bit fun here.
If you look at these waves under the tube, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've seen almost in light speed, weird effects, and Einstein would have seen this image incredibly.
The order of events in the world are going to appear in the camera in a more rapidly-replicated order, so by using the context of space and time, we can correct that bias.
So whether you're focusing on photography, or creating a new visual recognition of medicine or new design, since our invention has been able to open up and understand the details of the data on our website, and hope that the creator and the creative community is to stop us on the data, the pixels, the pixels, the next dimensions that we should start to the digital and the digital, the next, the next, the cameras are going to start to start to us to start to the
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many of the arguments don't go through, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors, and use things like stickers and chalk and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much renters pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscape better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is filled with the giant oak that has been filled with hundreds of years of loving ones, drunky and panors and priests. I trust a city where music is always music.
I think every time anyone never ever ever ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the left-down neighborhoods in America.
I live in the room, and I've been thinking about how I can make it, and I've also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpectedly.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great grateful gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in in in life now.
But it's hard to keep this view every day.
It's easy to lose your life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I transformed a side of the house in a huge board and I wrote a wall of the gaps, and I said, "I want to die, I want to come -- I want to come to the -- I can take a piece of chalk, and I can think about his life and share its hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely filled, and she grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to stand on the global line."
"I'm going to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm going to die." I want to live in webless."
"I'm going to die, I want to keep them in my arms."
"I'm going to die, I want to be a person's workill."
"I'm going to die, I'm going to be my own."
This is a place that was neglected to a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and the hardest times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's in a new way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important to us, while we grow and change and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of secret messages that wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a constructionbox in the world like Kazazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces, if we have the opportunity to speak up and share our voices with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is just close and sensitive.
We're often stopped talking about death or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthest us to most strength.
The idea of death is that life is showing us.
Our common spaces are the best part of what we care about as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories, we can't just help us create better places around us, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm involved in this with the math, which is a very special problem for anyone who's dealing with the math, is that we're like business workers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
That's why I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing.
Teaching is one of the most human activities.
We're excited about the sight of the master ballettett and batchers, as you're going to see.
On ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and there's a fundamental impulse that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroyed this extraordinary ability. It also does it with my slave, Jan Strival, who was at his time a balletviret.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
But there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the unpredictable symptom, like weaknesses, storms, sinidity, and others who are more likely to cause that disease, and that's why we need to discover objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We have to measure the progress objective, and ultimately the only way to know if there's cure, if we have a objective measure that might answer this question.
And I'm concerned about Parkinson's disease and other movements of movements, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing you have is this 20-minute test of neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies, it never will. Never.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a hospital to save, what if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have to be a worker.
It's actually 300 percent to study in the neurological unit.
So I want to suggest a very unconventional method that we're trying to do, because we're all, in a sense, virtual, like my Iranian Heritage Stital Station.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This is what happens in the healthy state, if somebody's writing the script, we can look at the rules of a ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal muscles, if we create the sounds, and we all have the genes for that. FoxP2, for example.
And how ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until they're learning.
And by the sound, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and the way the limbs are also affected by Parkinson's muscles.
The bottom record is an example of irregular vocal resonance analysis.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Beautor, weakness, sininess.
The language is even too hot and dried, and this is an example of aymptom.
This impact can be minimally, sometimes with digital microphones and brain analysis, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now tell where someone is in a syannelet between disease and health and health, just because of the vocal character.
How can these tests compare to clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test of neurologists.
Not much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And they're both accurate. They're not going to be done by experts.
So they can be done in their own.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in a large scale.
So this amazing goals we can do with this.
We can reduce logistics problems for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can achieve objective data by the current observation.
We can do low-cost mass-sourced investment research research and first study of the population is possible.
We now have the ability to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's Law Institute.
With Aculab and patient'sLikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough seed data for the release of these goals.
We have a reputation number that is accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who, with no Parkinson's disease, can buy cheaply to leave a few cents for a few cents, I'll give joy that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of samples, we say 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to tell that during the phone, whether this person has Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you may not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, in various circumstances, which is interesting, that environment is important, because we're going to turn these into the order to figure out which the actual markers are for Parkinson's Parkinson's disease.
At the time, their 86 percent accuracy has its ability?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to make him feel like he did this fantastic work -- has shown that it also works on the cell phone network, which enables this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
That means that people can -- people can call the phone and do the test. People could call Parkinson's disease, send their voice so that your doctor could check the progress of the disease.
That's true.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and the behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The city park is just in the south, and that means that wildlife animals can rely on the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night, and I woke up in the morning, and she found them dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buock.
My tribe, the stem of the Maai, believes that we came together with our animals and the Middle Easternland of the sky, so our animals mean so much.
I've learned lions as a child.
Our warrior's name. They protect our tribe and our herel. They're also put on this problem because of this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of the six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years of his father's cows, and that's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions are helping to see the cows better.
But I didn't have any money. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to be next to the cow's Day.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird's records and you go back again, but the next time they come, and they come, and they say, the thing doesn't move, and that's still there.
And they take off and kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the Stall. I was walking around a tap in the hand, and this time the lions didn't get into the tea.
Beers fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
And I was working all day in my room for a little boy, and I even took the new radio apart my mom, and the day she almost took me around electronics, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took a old car battery and a motor engine from a motorcycle. It shows if you want to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I got a switch to turn the lights out and off.
This is a little pearl from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panels are providing the battery, the battery is providing electricity to the right-source plant. I call it a transformer.
And the right-contus is blinking.
You can see that the pins are coming out, because the lions come from there.
And this is what the lions look like when they come.
The lights are shining, and the lions believe I'm walking around the bar, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our homes, and since then, we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've spent seven houses in the neighborhood carrying the lights and they're working really well.
Now, my idea is now used in Kenya, including other predators like hyops or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention has given me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse School School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has contributed to fundraising and education.
I even put my friends home, and we put the lights there, where there's no other, and I'm showing the people how to use them.
I only had a boy who was crying out of the savanna, who was crying his father's cows, and I saw airplanes about me and said, "I'm going to sit in a room day."
And here I am, I'm here.
I was allowed to draw a plane to my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to ignore lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions in common, we can live on the side of the lions, without arguments.
Ash<unk><unk>n<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got this scholarship. Yeah.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on a electrical fence. A electrode motor trick?
Yeah, I know electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it again, not even -- yes, I've tried it before, but I've given the attempt to give back because I got a -- a blow.
All right, Richard Turer, you're a little bit special.
We're going to hire you with each step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in your hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and not only of that.
There was no kind of director, no styleists, no possibility of shooting a picture, not even the lighting was seen.
To be honest, most of you have been shot by random tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk for a talk in New York, and my wife made this image that I hold my daughter on my arm on my first birthday. We were on the corner of 57 and five.
And this is the same picture that we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this is going from --
When my daughter daughter got closer, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York, and do it a father-law to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking the women who were going to come back to school, and we started to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to have a completely stranger, and you know, a camera is enough.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately nobody has never been able to play with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day, so a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a given moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to keep the time in October a week, and we're thinking about our time and how we're going to change from year to year, not just physically, but in particular, in the context.
Because although we always do the same image, our perspective of time is going on, and as they're always reaching new miles of the cliffs, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything, and how they see it.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value and expect every year.
And then, as one of our travels, we walked around a walk, and suddenly they were standing like this, and it shows up on a red bar on a tomato store that she had learned as a little child, at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she had thought of as five-year-old about this point.
She said she remembers her heart of the chest when she saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks at them in New York schools, because she's really going to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you this idea of taking a active role in conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like in you, but besides those 15 images, I'm not at all a family photo.
I'm always the one who makes this picture.
I want to encourage you today to come into the image and tell someone, "Would you like, do you make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
BLEU = 25.13, 55.4/31.9/19.8/12.4 (BP=0.979, ration=0.980)
