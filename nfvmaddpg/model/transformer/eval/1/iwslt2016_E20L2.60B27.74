When I was 11 years old, I was hit by the sounds of bright joy one morning.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual at the time, because the news was mostly depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power of Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned going to school.
So I was committing for five years as a boy and I was committing my older sister who was no longer allowed to go on a secret school.
It was only the only way we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way so that nobody could guess where we were going.
We hidden our books in shopping bags so it looked like we were just going to buy.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was a bit of a pleasant thing in the winter, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
All the time, all of a sudden, the class had to fall for a week because the Taliban had been caught up.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they advised us?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued and my daughters.
My grandfather was way ahead of his day.
An outsider from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted that his daughter -- my mother -- sent to school, and was rejected by his father.
My coach was a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to retire, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family who ever got an education.
For him, he was always aware that his children would be receiving an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He saw it as a much larger risk to send his children not to school.
I remember, in the years, I was so frustrated, sometimes, by the Taliban, by our lives, by the constant fear and of the shift of the perspective.
I was having a good joke to give up, but my dad said, "Excuse me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be displaced in war from your house.
But one thing is that you're going to stay with is what's inside of it, and even if we're going to pay for your blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So -- do you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have higher degree than high school, and if my family hadn't used so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm here today, a proudly unanimin of the Middlebury college.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was left by his family, was awarded to send his daughters to school, one of the first to contested me.
He's not only a senior graduate student, but also to say that I was the first woman and I'm driving him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more and more to dream for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a worldwide campaign for women's education.
So I've been able to create SOLA, the first and perhaps the only board for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls' school school has still been risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students of my school have great ambition to all of them to perceive their individual opportunities.
And seeing her parents and fathers standing for her, as well as my parents were doing, despite the fact that I was facing the worse and against the worse.
Like Ahmed, this is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of a student.
Just a month ago, his daughter was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they were the death of a bomb on the side of the road just for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang, and a voice beat him, if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.
He said, "Well, now, if you want to, I won't put my daughter's future on the line because of your aging and over-expived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I have noticed something that is often left in the West: the majority of us who have success, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that is aware of her success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not important in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are so compelling and persuasive to the recent future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is incompatible.
The Taliban went to school for a few hundred girls, because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, more than three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen in America, so different.
Americans recognize how unsafe these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not time and they're changing everything with the U.S. troops.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using it to encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan, to me, is a country of hope and the unlimited possibility, and that reminds me every day the girls who visit the SOLA.
Just like me, they have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, also professionally -- my life -- was coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977, I look young, but I'm not -- -- -- in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working on the technology of Africa.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years, we were Italian good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples of the Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people of the Italy in Sambaro how to raise food.
We went to the island with Italian seed in South Africa, in this compressed valley, which leads to Sambesi River, and we taught the local population to grow Italian tomato and tocini.
Of course, the local members had absolutely no interest in this, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they began to come.
We were amazed that in such a fertile valley, there was no agricultural agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Make time to save people from the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderfully ensured in Africa.
We had this gorgeous tomato tomato. In Italy, they were so big, so big in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the Himalayan novels, "Look, how simple agriculture is?"
When the tomato was mature and red, over the night, about 200 ninberers came out of the river and diked everything.
We said to the Himalayan novels, "Oh God, the nerds!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have farming here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were Italian-style, and I was so good in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the French did, and after seeing what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
At least we fed the pineper.
You should see the nonsense -- -- -- you should see the nonsense that we've given the lack of African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a comiatian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We Dutch countries have given the African continent a trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has taken.
Just read her book.
Read about an African African man, what we've managed to do.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we patrol them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisrig: I treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bony," the boss.
I was bitter when I read the book "mall's Beautiful" by "Dathery," and he said, most importantly, in economics, if people don't want help, they leave it alone.
This was the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolignate?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people and invent a system called corporate promotion, where no one ever is being initiated, but you will never be motivated to the service of the local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to be better.
What you do -- you keep your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put it together with the local locals.
We don't work from offices.
We're meeting in cafes. We're meeting in kitchiples.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friend relationships and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like this person, what do you want to do?
The passion for the growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing to humanity.
We're helping them find knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why, instead of getting into a community and saying, what do they do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
Entrepreneurs never have a participant, and they will never say public what they want to do with their money, what opportunities they see.
Design has this light spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be public meetings.
We're working to do one to do this, we've got to make social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the hospital of the company, who is sitting with you in the house, on your kitchen table, in the cafeteria, helps you find the means to transform your passion in a way that will guide your life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was a little Ph.D. student, trying to escape the turbulent flaws where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking around the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, my first customer, and I helped him. He was a big fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth in Perth, and he would come and join, and the fishermen would come, "You helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishermen work together and I helped them not sell these amazing tuna in Albany, in 60,Kilo, but to Japan, for Sushi, for 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped. Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I keep the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- So the government says, "Tell it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the process of building this.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on on on loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business advisers of history, died at 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was involved in companies. Peter's printer said, in fact, planning is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and the economy."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch without knowing what the smartest human Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to you.
You have to provide discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they'll come up with a little bit.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What presentation do you most cheated for tomorrow?
<unk>uite passionate people. You hated them.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- abortible fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open species of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in a sustainable way, to replace, to transport them, to verb them.
The technologies don't exist for that.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Do universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it.
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York in 1860s.
In 180, they came together and they created what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was, the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grew on the speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get the crap done with six million horses.
Because they were already staying in the crap.
In 180, they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the U.S. -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology had made the race. There were tiny little factories in the backyard of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing is that they have to be offered discretion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
The next thing you have to do is offer them absolute, dedicated and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all needs to be able to perform three things: to sell the product that must be great, the market market market must be great, and the financial accounting has to be huge.
So guess what?
We never met a single person who can simultaneously produce something, sell and care for money.
That's not what it doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We did research and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have, only one thing that's founded not just one person.
Now we teach 16 years of training in Northeast entrepreneurship, and we start giving them the first two pages of Richard Bransons Autobiography, and the task of the 16 year-old children is to support the first two pages of Richard Bransons of Autography, how many of them use the word "I," and how many times the word "weak."
Never "I" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he began.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator has a small residential background, sit in cafes and bars. Their dedicated coins who will do for them, what someone has done for this gentleman who's talking about this vinnrami. Somebody will say, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support organizations to help them find the tools and people. We've found that the wonders of the public health, that the culture and the economy can be transformed, only by opening up the passion, energy and imagination of the people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be in Alice's wonderful country.
So Penn State University asked me -- a faculty for communications -- to share challenges in communication.
I was afraid.
I'm really afraid. I'm afraid of these students with big brains and their big books and their big books, I'm not sure about the same words.
But when the conversation evolved, it took me like Alice, when she was pushing down to the pig's brake and saw a door to a completely new world.
And so I felt like I was talking to students, and I was amazed by the idea they had, and I wanted other people to find that other wonder country was coming.
I think to open up these door, it requires great communication.
We really need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones we face our biggest problems, like energy, environment and health, and if we don't know about it, it's not going to go anywhere. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
I want to show you some of the approaches that you can do, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, well, what?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only does you tell the pig phrases to explore, but also tell us that their cheeks, the pillods, the material structure in our bones, are looking at it, because it's important to understand and treat osteoposis.
And if you describe what you do, then you have preventable dictionary.
The dictionary is a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use "discovery" and time, but why don't you just say "space and time," what is a lot more pleasant for us?
And we're going to be able to understand your thoughts is not the same as to down the level of your level.
As Einstein said before, "Take things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can certainly tell us something about your scientific field without having to address tradeoffs.
So a few things to consider: examples, stories and analogies. That's how you can pull us into your worm.
And when you present your work, the dots are gone away.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "all point?"
What happens when someone else gets to mind? One is about to be stabting, and with those dots you get to your audience.
A slide like this is not only boring, but it also fits too much to the wisdom part of our brain, and that's why we're very quickly challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more potent. It shows that the particular structure of the pigmentation is so robust that it was even the inspiration for the original design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple phrase where the audience can react to the thread once it loses, reuse images and graphics that also helps our other senses and make a deeper understanding of what you're telling.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up this door and see the wonder land that celebrates science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the "Nossally within me," I want to summarize everything with an equation.
As you look at your science and your word, you divide it through the relevance, so the audience tells you what's important, and you multiply the passion you have for your incredible work: and that, of course, consisting of the unimaginable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solve this equation, I'm really excited about it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the human country with a cell phone.
You can Tweet a message with a cell phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song and you can get high-pressed on sound cloud and famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in time in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this city.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going to the street and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're wondering that all these people who were coming up and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. An Android, an Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, my cell phone wants to talk about me and my cell phone about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 points of information.
Wealth data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. has set up a policy.
This is a rule of law enforcement protection.
This is a rule of law that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service provider in all of Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls who? Who gets an email?
Who is going to send a text message to whom?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored on the order of at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And all over Europe, people have been up and said, "We don't want to do that."
They said we don't want to have this legal backup.
We want self-in-generation self-stirst-art, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of whom said, "We don't want that."
And here you can see tens of thousands of people pouring out on the streets of Berlin, saying, "Sunity instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be in Stasi 2.0.
The wasard's Codol police in Eastern Germany.
And I also wonder, is this really working?
Can all of this information really store over us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the German telecom company, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, give me all the information you saved.
And I asked her one time, and I asked her again, and I didn't get a right answer. Only a half Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that you're doing the dishes.
So I decided to put a court test on them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was a comparison with them.
I'm going to take the suggestion back what they're asking me to send all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court mandate decided that the E.U. was a German right response to the law.
So I got this ugly brown conflating with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 points of information.
First I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My approach.
But then I realized, after a while, that's my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them happen.
Because I want to show people what is the law enforcement of law.
So with time online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can track every step I make.
And you can even see Frankfurt driving along the train to K<unk>c<unk>n, and how many calls I walk along.
And this is all possible by this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we'll talk a few times.
And then a few friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call up, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, at times they call each other, when they go to bed.
You can see all of that.
You can see the central figures, like who is the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what makes society.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a design plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who talks to who to whom to send an email, all of that is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we imagine all these people in the streets of Berlins, in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the ace of the was who had known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders had been, it might have never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And not the case of the Iron Hemisphere after that.
Because today, as national agencies and companies want to store so much information as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all well for a long time.
But self-determination and life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So when you go home, tell your friends that privacy is the 21st century value, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, tell your persecutor, just because companies and state countries have the capacity to store certain information, they don't have to do it very long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to struggle for your own self-stirst-old self-stirst.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: domestic stores, rapid restaurants, brkops.
So the city planners come together and they figured out changing the name of South Central to make it happen for something else, and they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what goes wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Ordinary stores, rapid restaurants, bridestops.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive Store and the Drivebys.
The fun thing is that the Drive-thrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the world who are ignorant.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it is in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't see that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, you see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I realize that roll-up is purchasing and sold as a vehicle.
I see combling centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that must stop.
I realized the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and food is the solution.
I didn't like that, on 45 minutes' worth of college to get an apple that is not contacted with pesticides.
So I planted a food deforestation in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call parking lots.
It's 45 feet in diameter.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to do it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to stay in."
And I decided to keep it in the state like this.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, together, and we started planting my food forest, and fruit trees, all the program, vegetables.
We're a sort of executive group, together from gardening all the social layers and all over the city, it's completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically assigned me a plane, and said I had to remove my garden, the supply was going to become a seduction arrangement.
And I thought, "Okay, come on, right?
A seductive version of growing food on a piece of land that you're completely not comfortable with?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city Council and I talked to a member of Green Ground, and they made a petition on Change.org, and with 900 Signatures, we were successful.
We held the victory in our hands.
My city council even called, and said they support it and love what we do.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the largest bride in the United States in the property of the city.
They have 42 square kilometers of bride.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should they not find that right?
Through growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my treasure message, I tell people to grow their own food.
To expand its own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew up my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I built my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Homework is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's drawing walls, I'm drawing lawns and park equipment.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my valves for this stuff.
You would be surprised what the ground can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was becoming an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
You would wonder how children are affected by this.
So the garden is the most therapeutic and most bold act that you can do, especially in the city.
And you also get strawberry.
I remember that time that this time that her mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my garden, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not for purpose in the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that only drove me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you don't worry that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "For God, no, I'm not afraid they're going to make a shit.
And that's what the street is all about.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back their health."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me fleet the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it affected them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it was just a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people come and they came with us, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get any of that, if they don't show how food and body influence affects, they eat blind, whatever you vote for.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that they've been looking for, and they're not going to lead anywhere.
The gardening is an opportunity to train these children to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could bring George Washington Carver to the next George Washingtonver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground Earth, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipping container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free stop, because free is not sustainable.
The fun thing about sustainability is that you have to stop it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting children from the streets, and getting the pleasure and the pride and honor when you build their own food, and when you open farmers' markets.
So, what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want to be able to become all environmental rebel, gangsters, gangster gardeners.
We have to turn the picture of the gang.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You know, you're going to go to the squad, right?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're going to sit in the web chairs and you want to make a meeting where you're talking about doing some math.
If you want to meet me, come with your shaft, in my backyard, so that we can plant some shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nollygoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "snollygoster" means "the non-profit."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher gave a better definition: "A snollygoster is someone who is consistent with a party, regardless of the mission or the mission, and his success by the sheer power of the monumental acoustic bias."
I have no idea what the editing is.
Something I think is, in words.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers, were not able to distort exactly the same vocabulary of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with this extraordinary name called Brass Crosby, who was looking at with the parliament.
They threw him in the Tower of London, and he gave him a big challenge, and he was courageous enough to pursue, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the phrase "so as Brass." Many believe.
Brass is a local word for the English brand.
But that's not true. It's all about a government of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time that it has just reached independence.
And you could look at the question of, like George Washington, the head of state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a bankrupt nation?
And there was a debate about this in Congress for infinitely long.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-city George Washington, and other people, the supply of the God of the United States of America, Washington.
Not that special.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was preventable.
They weren't monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with a little bit of embarrassment because this debate was doing three weeks.
I read the journal of a senior singer who wrote all the time: "I've got the same issue."
The reason for the delay and boredom was that the Kansas House was against the Senate.
The Kansas House representative didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want him.
King call it, and maybe even give it to ideas for its outcomes.
They wanted to give him the most humble, innocuous, horrifying title, which they thought of.
This title was "The Princeor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only meant someone had a gathering.
It's sort of like the firing of a jury.
He had no longer been the size of the drawing "playory" or "raft water."
Sometimes there were little presidents of small colonial and government groups, but it was really a misguptive title.
That's why the Senate refused to leave him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up the agreement and meet foreign-time watchers.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, you would have to think of it as being the ultimate definition of being the word, but they really wanted to make it absolutely clear that they didn't agree that they were honest for the opinions and civilized nations, whether it was in the Republic or monarchy, where it is the case of the state of the state of the state, it's not a validity of the presidency, and the general, the general, the United States, it's not the
You can learn three interesting things from this.
One is -- and I think that's the best -- I've never been able to figure out if the Senate has ever given the title of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just awarded the title. He just waits for the Senate to be active.
The second thing you can learn is that if a government says something is temporary -- -- you'll wait 223 years later.
Third, and this is really important, and that's the most important point, is that the theme of the United States today is not so humbling, right?
It has to do with something more than 5,000 nucleic heads that it has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title of size.
And that's how the Senate ended.
They got a respectable title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the meaning of self-interest -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
Four-7.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the day, the Senate was lost, and the representation of the house was because nobody feels humble when you're told you're the President of the United States now.
And that's the most important thing you can take away and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes a lot more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came up in a truck about 50 rustels at the fight for jalalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm listening to my black Converse semi-king for a pair of brown leatherters and a rocket headed towards the government regime that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I'd been big before the war, but I'd been on the news with the Sljama party and football talks and playing soccer games and posting with racist Southeasts and heroics, which never had ever known to travel with communism and live in Afghanistan, and have to tap on burial records before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here to be, a fully-spused Afghans, South-states by God Gaden, an atheist, and a radical political artist who has been working and created for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So, there's a lot of really amazing things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like painting rain paintings. I want art to engage the personality and challenges the authority and re-vision the reality and that even use a kind of imaginative citizenship to try and understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- funeral who charges his jihad against communityist, like "Popheadheadhead," and uses armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the law enforcement as a candidate for Parliament and making a choice campaign saying, "Do I pray? I do jihad and I'm rich."
And I'm trying to use this campaign to disappoint this mafiosi that are spending as a national hero.
I want to make the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "talking," where you're a policeman, you build a false control center on the streets of Kabul, and you're going to take cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, supply money, and you're willing to give them money, and in the name of the police department, in Kabul, and you're hoping that they're 100 of the police.
I want to look at what was the conflict in Afghanistan, I think, of the Intermodist conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him had created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a forensic training for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I put the fur of indigenous Afghan talent and an indigenous servant, or a multi-metted, or a new, co-friendly, community-class athletic work.
And I'd like to see what a simple pusher looks like in Kabul between Kiplell Appell, 1899 to create a dialogue about how the current development organization is going to have its roots in the past of warographic rhetoric about the White Bear's "The Father of Dine" to protect the brown man from himself and maybe even a little more civilized.
But for all of these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood, they can misuse.
But I do, because I have to because the geography of self requires it.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for some time I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, I've been saying it.
I feel like I've now been building an incredibly painful tension in this room, because I shouldn't have the dress.
Fortunately, I have something to do with change.
This is the first time someone is attracted to the TED stage, so you can be happy to see that, I think.
If some women were really embarrassed when I came out, you don't need me to say this, I'll read this later on on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
That's not everybody who has the opportunity.
These tracks are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to carry them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me off, so don't do anything long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, I hope it wasn't as embarrassing as this picture.
And a image is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to go on my back and put my hand into the hair of this guy.
And besides surgeries or the wrong brine that I took two days ago to do this, there's very few ways to change our utterness, and our utter utterance -- even though it's superficial and irreversible -- a huge impact on our lives.
To be fear is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason, as I became a model, is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important heritage, and you might be wondering, what is this legacy?
Well, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, where we are biologically programmed, but also as big, sliff, feminine and brightcomans.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been offered for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point. And maybe some fashion masteres might say, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liw."
And first, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has counted all the modules on the run, every single one that was being dated, and that of 677-numbers, only 27 or less, four percent of the time they didn't know.
The next question I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?"
And I first say, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give to these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be anything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-Sarm surgeon, which would be completely wrong, because then you'd be the first one."
If they still say after this great paraphrase, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who is my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the president of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to become a model later, like saying you want to win the Jackpot in the Lotto.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career path.
Now I want to show you 10 years of digitally, of model, because unlike heart surgeon, it can only be unfolding right now.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is just like a nice flier, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a photo to run," well, the leg first goes fine, long, long, that arm goes back, this arm, that arm is on the front, three-quarters of the time, and you just move back, and you can see it's just going back to your, 400-year-old friends, 400-old,
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what was happening.
If you finish school and have a whole space and have a few jobs, you can't tell much more. If you say you want to be President of the United States, but the whole is, "10 years of underwear," you'll look at weirdness.
The next question that I'm often asked is, "Whoever will channel all the photos?"
And yes, pretty much all the photos are stored, but that's just a small part of what's going on.
This is the first photo I took, and this was the very first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my time back then.
I know it's pretty personal right now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this film.
My friend had to accompany me.
This is me on a Pyjama party a few days before a magazine magazine magazine.
This is me with the football team and the V-D magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you'll see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, Hairstylists and remixers and photographers and stylists and all of their fellow pilots and post-teemments. They build. That's not me.
Okay, so next thing, people always ask me, "Well, did you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-inch-mimeter gloves I can never carry, except the things I get for free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was walking over a red light, and of course, we were stopped. It took me a "Sorority, Mr. Wacht champion," and we could go on.
I got these kind of free things because of my appearance, not because of my personality, and there are people who pay a lot of money for their appearance, not for their personality.
I live in New York, and I live in the 140,000 teens who have been shot and filtered in the last year, and was 85 percent black and Latino, and most of the time, young men.
It lives only 177,000 young male and Latino in New York who doesn't ask the question: "Am I stopping?"
It was, "How often am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
So I found out, in my research, that 53 percent of all 13 years of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is 78 percent when they got 17.
The last question I have to say is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they'll expect that answer: "If you're a little bit thin and glitter hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backstage, we'll give a answer that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never ever say before the camera, what I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I more happy if I had thin legs and shiny hair?"
Then you should meet some models, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool puppies, and they're the ones that probably aren't going to be the ones that seem to be unsafe women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to get a very honest balance, because on one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to sit here and say, "I got all the benefits from a block that was drawn to my favor," and it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was very difficult to really open up a heritage of oppression for gender and race if I'm one of the largest supplementters of it.
But I'm also happy and honored to stand here, and I think it's amazing that I've managed to do it here before 10 or 20 years of time, and my career has stayed still, because I probably wouldn't say how I got my first job, or I wouldn't tell, I wouldn't tell, I wouldn't tell you, like, I'd have been paid college, which is so important.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our supposed successes and failures more.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother, who came to life in exile: "Son, saddafi Resist. Gush it.
But never become something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been around for almost two years since the Libyan Revolution has been discovered by the waves of mass customization in both those who are in the Egyptian revolution.
I joined many other Libyians, within and outside Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyrannic regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, Libyan women and men stood in the first row, challenged the end of the regime, stopped Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They proved an astronomer by competing against the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They have shown a powerful sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west, to the south.
Finally, after six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we were able to free our country and to drown the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a great brush, a legacy of the tyranny, corruption and the basis of the change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis tyrannic regime has destroyed both the infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
I realized the devastation and the challenges, as many other women, re-growing civil society Lybacia, and we challenged a predatory and legitimate transition to democracy and national justice.
Near to 200 organizations, while and immediately, Gaddafis was founded in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of exile, I came back to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I began to organize workshops to creativity, human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the leadership platform of Liby Women, leadership leaders of different living, whose goal is to meet publicity for women, and to our right for equal stewardship for the leadership of democracy and peace.
In the general election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was vastly colderized, a environment which was shaped by the selfish political politics of dominance and execution.
I led an initiative to the Leadership Council of Borges to achieve a predatory choice, a law that any citizen, no matter what the back, should be the right to vote and take a job, and most importantly, to establish a shift between male and female candidates in the vertical and horizontal level and the new and complete a constant position.
At the end of it, our initiative was over and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the national debate in the first state of the country for the first 52 years.
But it was very, very seriously, the history of the election and the entire revolution, because every day, we were turning on new news about violence.
We were entering a morning of travel through pre-vising immigrants and Sufi masters.
On another morning, we got a message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack.
And then another morning, the troindments of the armed forces were signed to the army.
And really every day, under the sovereignty of militias and their ongoing impact against human rights and their abortion of laws and laws.
Our society is shaped by a revolutionary human spirit, polarized, and distant from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they had initially stopped.
Intolerance, decay, and revenge became the icon of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our pressing and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to confess that as a nation, we have made false choices and false decisions.
We've mislevalted our priorities.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or security to Lybias.
Did the hard-to-dist and change between female and male legislative peace and national refinement?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why is our society going to keep polarizing and dominating selfish politics of dominance and purpose, both men and women?
Perhaps the women were not the only ones that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the compliment.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus to the extent that it needed the election, which ultimately has only strengthen the polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting on behalf of anger and calling a day of revenge.
We have to start acting on the name of compassion and the gistade.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only does the following values, but also gives it a case: Bully, cooperation instead of competition, rather than execution.
These are the ideals that desperately need one of the war to unite lybia to get peace.
Because peace has an alchemy, and in that alchemy, it's about the communication of the feminist and the maskal view.
That's the real punch.
And we have to implement that in existential terms before we do it socio-sex.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam," "Love the word of the Good God, raping."
The word "radem" again, which is known in all of the abrally-an traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "inparin" symbolizes the maternal feminine, which surrounds the whole humanity, the man-in-the-them and the female, of all the tribes and all the tribes.
And just as the mother's abdomen grows in his embryo, completely surrounds the basic nature of compassion all of its existence.
And so we were told, "My Gnoade is all about things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade has prelimited my Groll."
May all of us be saved by the Gnoade of Gah.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up using the song "nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were touring the story of Kim Ilung, but we were not very much learning about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until I was changing all of this.
At age seven, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from a colleague of mine's sister.
And he said, "If you did this, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore, because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're all on the ground together, and our bodies are so weak that we're dying soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly after that, I went past the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A bleeding woman was lying on the ground, and a boiling child in her arm was turning helplessly into his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because everyone was so busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-1990s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were dying of famine, and many more people survived because they ate grass, beetles and tree lamps.
Lightfalls became more and more and more, so that at night, everything was too blurred to me, except for the lights of China on the other side of the tag that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of amp, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very high in its valleys, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you much about how I left North Korea, but I can say that during the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought I was separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take 14 years to get back together.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea what life would be as a North Korean refugee, but I soon learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous. It's also a very dangerous thing to see North Korean refugees in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in a constant fear that my real identity could fly in, and you would be sent back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was realized when I was caught by the Chinese police and sent to the police department.
Somebody took me to be a North Korean woman, so they tested my Chinese convictions and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
If anything is unnatural, I could be imprisoned and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the poll, a senior official said to the other one, "That was a false failure.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China have been scavenging in foreign messages called Asyl, but many are caught by the Chinese police and rejected.
These girls were very lucky.
Despite being caught, they were finally released by tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have that much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are rejected to North Korea, where they are tortured, imprisoned or imprisoned in public.
Although I was fortunate enough to escape, many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that northern Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle to survive.
After they've learned a new language and learned a new language, their world can be put on their heads in a moment.
So after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life again.
In South Korea, I had a bigger challenge than I would have thought of.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I also have seen the difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very divergent, because of 67 years of division.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northan-aged lady?
Where am I from? Who am I?
All of a sudden, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I was not slightly mild about the Southern Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the demonstration in university.
Just as I got better on my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities started the money I was sending my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to resign to a remote place on the country.
They had to escape as quickly as possible, so I began to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to go through an incredible distance on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I moved to the North Korean border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run them, on more than 2,000 miles through China, and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed, and told him they were muff, and I was herding.
He looked at me in a treseless way, but fortunately, he believed me.
We managed to go all the way to the low-riction, but I had to search for almost all of my money to get the boundary control of Laos.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and scrap paid for a month, my family was released, but shortly after that, my family was rebuilt, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest disengage of my life.
I had done everything to protect my family to freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the Southern Korean Embassy.
I went and I went from the immigration agency and the police department, and I was desperate to let my family go, but I didn't have enough money to pay back on the scrap or money.
I lost all my hope.
And the guy asks me, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a foreign stranger would care about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and he went to a bank machine, and he paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get it out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the Northan Indians."
I realized this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous foreignist symbolized me to be a new hope that the North Koreans needed so well, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope-fight that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back together in South Korea, but the freedom is only a step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little or no money at all.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, the professional education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family members, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I want to pursue hope to succeed in Northern Koreans with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce my brothers to you now.
Remi is 22, big, very good.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He discrete it in a shame, and he narrows it away.
It's not stupid. It's not paying attention to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to think about words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: How little we know about the mind and how amazing the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
It has an absolutely unmreatable memory.
But it also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he was stolen my chocolate card, but he remembers every song on my iPod, talking about four when he was the first episode of the teapleties on my arm, and he was committing on my helmet birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds are not acting in the social version of normal, they're often over and understood and wrong.
But what encouraged my heart and my soul was that, although that was the case, although they were not commonplace, that only one could mean they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affect social communication, learning and sometimes physical skill.
It's different to each individual, so Remi is different from the same as Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes is discovered in a new person, and while it's one of the fastest growing interventions in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've encountered autism, but I can't remember it every day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized it was different.
He screamed a lot.
He didn't want to play like the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested at me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, laying the washing machine and eating everything that was handed up.
And as he grew up, he became different, and the differences became apparent.
But behind the rage and the groove and the hidden hyperactivity, something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been to be lied.
Remarkable.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments where I wished they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normal, the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift. Each one of us has a gift in it. And in all fairness, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying at the moment we're trying to do things like being different.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been filled with curiosity and curiosity, and this photo on a project on a project of an apple, and it's a cat-lived cat-laped, and it's only a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we're not seeing the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto imaging photography, a new engineering technique that's so fast to make the slow motion of light.
And so we can build cameras that are beyond our view of view, looking out at corners or without an <unk>-ray in our body and actually ask what we mean with the camera.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it into a billionth of a second -- these are several seconds of a second -- I create a package of photons that is barely a millimeter wide, and this photonsite, this project, this project, is moving on the speed of light, and I said, a million times faster than the normal project.
So, if you take this project, this photon pack and you put it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So, this whole event.
So remember, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotore -- as long as the light required to move this lane, but I'm trying to make this video more than 10 billion so you can see the light moving.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't funded this research.
So, this film is happening a lot, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, takes a beam of photon pack that starts to move through and eventually breaks in the inside.
Part of the light goes outwards to the table, and you see that spreading the waves.
Most of the photons eventually reach the melting of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble there that hangs around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflective layers above, you see the reflection at the end of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and let it go back the same track and slow the video back at 10 billion, you know, how long do you have to sit here to see the film?
One day, one week? No, no, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- -- -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about something still-lapse photography?
You can see again, these waves of the table, the glass and the wall upside down in the background.
It's like throwing a rock in a pond.
It seemed to me, as though nature was painting a photo, each of which was a femto image, but of course our eye is a folded image.
But if you look at this Tomate again, you'll see that when the light goes over the pits, it's not going to get any darker.
Why is that? Because the Tomate has ripe, and the light goes around in you after a few billion seconds,
So in the future, if this Femto camera is installed in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you could go into a supermarket and find out if a fruit is a fruit, and not even touching it.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with a brief amount of moisture, you have very little light, but we put a billion times faster than your shortest mass of war, so you don't get any light whatsoever.
So what we're doing is we're sending this projectile, this photo pack, a million times, and we're drawing it again with very clever synchronization, and we're going to combine this gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but what about a new supercomputer for a future superhero: to see corners?
The idea is that we're turning light on the door.
It will be repuriated, into space, and part of it will be reflected back to the door, and eventually we could exploit that multiple-stranded light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually done it already.
On the left you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden in a soup, and we're going to be able to push the light on the door.
After our papers were published in the Nature Communications Institute, it was taken up by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to defer this light project, and they're going to open up this wall, and this photons pack is all over the direction, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will then break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light, and then suddenly a tiny fraction of the photons of the photons will come back to the camera, but it's going to be very interesting at the very close to the
And because we have a camera that is so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique capacity.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And so of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point is to what distance.
By making a laser light up, we can record a combustatory image that -- as you can see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but then when we take many of these pictures, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light courses, then we can see the object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got to do something else before we can put this into practice, we could make cars that can avoid collisions and recognize what's behind the curve, or we can search for dangerous treatment by looking at light through open windows, or we can build endcones that look deep into the body around Ok Brochops and also in the air.
But because of the blood and tissue, that's very challenging, of course, that's really a wake-up call for scientists to think about Femto photography, because a new imaging process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, has become an art of the ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data we're collecting every single time, we're using, not just the scientific processing process. We can create a new form of computer photography with paint and painting, and we can look at these waves between the time.
But it's also a fun thing to do here.
If you look at these waves under the tube, you can see the waves moving away from us.
The waves should move us around.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've almost been recording light speed, weird effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The sequence in which events in the world appear in a recurring order, in a recurrent order, in order to implement the actual relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So whether it's for photography, whether it's for connections or for the creation of a new representation for medicine or new exhibiting, since our invention, we've been able to digitize all the data and details on our website, and hope that the operators, the creative and the research community, will allow us to stop coming up on the megapixs, to the next one, to start to advance the next scale, and to start to be able to advance the
It's about time. Thank you.
There's many ways that our fellow people can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many of the wisdom is not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the last few years, using things like stickers and cruises and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned building and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for never-to-face houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is reassured by the huge osteas that have been served for hundreds of years, blessing, drunks and dreats, and I have a community where there is always music.
I think every time anyone never gets, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the hidden parts of America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I could get it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it brought me clarity about the things that are now important to me in life.
But it's hard for me to keep this view on a daily basis.
It's easy to lose your life expectancy and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I transformed a page of the abandoned house into a huge blackboard, and I wrote a scourge of the ceiling, "If I die, I want to die, I want to die, I would like to have to have to have a piece of chalk, I can take a piece of life and I can think about his life and share his hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it was growing.
I want to share some sentences with you, which were written by the people on the wall.
"Before I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I'd rather be mortal, I want to stand across the International Recession."
"Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to live on the first way to die."
"Before I die, I want to hold it in my arms once."
"Before I die, I want to be a piece of music."
"I want to be myself before I die."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people made me laugh, to cry and to satisfy me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and appropriate way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of news stories from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I teamed up a construction kit, and now in the world, in Southeast countries like Kazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power our public spaces have when we have the opportunity to rise our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right look and think life is short and delicate.
We often are being stopped talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I realized that the preparation on death is one of the things that strengthens us the most.
The idea of death reveals us life.
Our common spaces are the best to us as individuals and as communities, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and our fears and stories, people around us can't just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm looking at the cognitive math, a special problem for anyone who's been looking at the cognitive math, is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try to explain what I do.
Teaching is one of the most human activities.
We are thrilled at the sight of the feather ballet and teammers, as you'll see.
Now, for ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental signal that might have a genetic element.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroyed this extraordinary ability, and that also makes it my beloved Jan Basass, which at the time was a ballet-food.
Over the years, we've been doing a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this illness, and they have to live with the inevitable symptoms like weakness, harassment, and other people who are more likely to live that disease, and that's why we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately, the only way to know whether there is a cure if we have an objective to answer this question.
Lunity is that for Parkinson's and other disorders of motion, there's no biomarker, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing there is in this 20-minute test at neurologist.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside of clinical trials, it never does. Never happens.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't have to be a corporate hospital.
It's actually 300 percent, by the way, to look at the neurologic department.
So I want to suggest a very unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a sense, virtual reality, like my Iranian companion.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal sound breaking.
This is what happens in the right state of the mind of somebody who's making voice sounds, and we can look at them as a mood ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all of these vocal organs if we make sounds, and we've all created the genes for it.como2, for example.
And like ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn to talk.
And by the sound, we can determine the position of the vibrant vocal muscles, and just like the limb, the muscles are affected by Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom record, you can see an example of irregular vocal delusions.
We always see the same symptoms.
Regorious, weakness, stiffness.
The language is even more wis and twisted, and that's an example of theymptom.
And so the effects of the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision processing technology combined with new machine learning, which is now very advanced, we can now now now tell where someone lies in a spab between disease and health, just because of the vocal machinery.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test of neurologists.
It's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are accurate. That's not what the arguments are done for.
So they can be done on their own.
They're very fast, maximum 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it at a very large scale.
So we can do this amazing goals.
We can reduce logistical problems for patients.
Patients don't have to perform routine control in the hospital.
We can gain objective data through widely observational observations.
We can do the cheap massage of clinical trials and we can first test for the entire population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this, we're going to start the Parkinson's Law Initiative.
With Aculab and patient'sLike, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough seed data for the success of these goals.
We have calls numbers that are accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on the planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's, can be a cheap call to leave a few-centimeter record. I'm very aware that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from, say 10,000 people, you can tell who is healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to tell if the patient had to suffer Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you may not be able to finish it.
But we collect a huge database, in certain circumstances, which is interesting. The circumstances are important, because we're in order to exploit it to determine which markers are for Parkinson's.
Right now, you have 86 percent accuracy.
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he did such amazing work -- showed that it's also working on the cellular network, which allows this project to be done, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
That is, people can -- people can call a phone call and do the test. People with Parkinson's call, call their voice so that your doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and the mine behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in part of the south, and that means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night, and I woke up in the morning, and I found them dead. It was terrible. It was our only hobby.
My tribe, the colony of the Masai, believes we came together with our animals and our open land of the sky, and that's why our animals mean so much to us.
I was a kid who had only learned to hate lions.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our enemies. They're also listed because of this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park, there's only so few lions.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years old for his father's cows. That's what it was about.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, it would help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird gait.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow shed.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird magazines, and you go back, but the next time, they come and say, well, the thing doesn't move, that's still here.
And they reach out and kill our livestock.
One night, I woke up the rubble. I walked around with a torch in the hand, and that time the lions didn't sign.
Bears fear the light that moves.
I had an idea.
As a little boy, I was working all day in my room, and once again, I took the new radio from my mother, and the day she was almost about me, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a motor commander from a motorcycle, and it suggests if you want to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little pintot from a broken flashlight.
And then I built it all together.
The solar panel will propel the battery, provide power to the action plant. I call it a transformer.
And the power of the action is blinking.
You can see the pins show outwards, because there's the lions coming from.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights blink, and the lions believe I'm walking around the rubble, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our home, and since then, we haven't had any problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights on. You can see the lions in the background.
I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really doing well.
My idea is now used all over Kenya, including for other predators like hyena or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep track of elephants from soft.
My invention helped me to go to a grant to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is dedicated to fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights where there is none, and I show people how to use them.
One year ago, I was just a boy from the savanna who was snapping his father's cows. I looked across me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of my day."
And here I am.
I was invited to do a plane with my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a pilot engineer and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to hunt lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions in common, we can live side by side with the lions, without the argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't really know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship now. Yes.
They work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next part of the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. An electroenceable.
Yes, I know electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- yeah, I've tried it a little while, but I've given a try, because I got a blow.
It's hard to start with. Richard Turder, you're something special.
We're going to hire you on any step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite paintings, and I have never done one of them.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting was being accepted.
To be honest, most of them were shot from random tourists.
My story begins when I was a lecture in New York, and my wife made this picture where I held my daughter on my first birthday on my arm, and we were on the corner of 57th and five.
And just a year later, we went back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this is going --
When my daughter's third birthday came up, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do a father-daughter meeting to continue the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking tourists about making a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a complete stranger to take your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately nobody has ever been tucked with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred to us.
This one was taken just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day, so that a five-year-old could understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a fixed moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to pause in October a week and change time and how we change year after year, not just physically but in everything.
Because although we always make the same image, our perspective of time to time, as it's reaching new milestone, I can see life with its eyes as it does and it's dealing with everything it sees.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value, and expect for a year.
And recently, during one of our trips, we walked for a walk, and suddenly it remained as if it were to be executed, it shows up on a red bar on a dollkin, which she had learned as a little kid, at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she had been diagnosed for as five-year-old at the exact same point.
She said she remembers her heart hopped out of her chest when she first saw the store nine years ago.
And now she looks at the New York public schools because she really wants to study in New York.
And I realized quite clearly that the most important thing we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not on a family photo at all.
I'm always the one who makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come into the picture and tell someone, "Would you like to make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 27.74, 58.7/35.3/22.8/15.1 (BP=0.955, ration=0.956)
