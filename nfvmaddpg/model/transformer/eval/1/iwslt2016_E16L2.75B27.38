When I was 11 years old, I was hit by the sounds of a hopping joy one morning.
My father heard the news show on his little, awful radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual at the time, because the news was mostly depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so I was commounded for five years as a boy and I was advising my older sister who was not allowed to go alone to a secret school.
And so we could go both to school.
Every day, we took another way so nobody could guess where we went.
We're hidden in our books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just going to buy a grocery store.
We've been done in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was kind of a fun thing in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and over and over again, the class had to be accidental for a week because the Taliban had spotted.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to tell us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school anyway.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was critical and valued and valued daughters.
My grandfather was way ahead of his day.
A foreign stranger from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted that his daughter -- to send my mother -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
But my trained mother became a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retire just to turn our home into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first in his family ever received an education.
For him, he was always realized that his children would get an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He saw it as a much greater risk to send his children not to school.
I know that in the years, I was so frustrated, sometimes, under the Taliban, by our lives, by the constant fear and the valence.
I was having a good joke to give up, but my dad said, "Excuse me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be displaced from your home in war.
But one thing will always remain you: what's inside of this. And even if we have to pay for our blood for your school fees, we'll do that.
So -- do you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have a higher degree than a high school degree, and if my family hadn't been so much used for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, when a proudly unmathin of the Midbury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was upset by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first congratulations.
It's not just a graduate student at college, but it's also me that I was the first woman and I'm who runs him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more and more common dreams for me.
And so I'm a global leader for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
And so I've helped to start to build SOLA, the first and perhaps the only board of girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls' school school school can still be risky.
It's wonderful to see the students at my school who are having great ambition to all of them take a chance.
And see her parents and fathers standing for them, as my parents were then, despite the end of all, despite the worse.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they were the death of a bomb on the side of the road just for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang, and a voice beats him, if he sent his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, "You know, I'm going to get me right now, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your aging and over-expived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often abrupt in the West: behind most of us who succeed, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and who is aware of her success as well.
That's not to say that our moms are not going to matter what we're going to do in our success.
In fact, they're the people who are often well-versive and compelling and persuasive to the prospective future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And under the Taliban, there were a few hundred girls going to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, more than three million girls are pressing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen from America, so different.
Americans recognize how unsafe these changes are.
I'm afraid that change is not over time, and it's changing everything with the United States population.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them for them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and unlimited opportunity, and that is what I remember every day the girls going to the SOLA.
Just like I have these great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, including professionally -- my life -- was coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977, I look young, but I'm not -- -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working on the projects of technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I think 21 years, we're Italian good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples at the Zambezi," was one of the things we wanted to show Islamic Sambias about how food was being grown.
We went to the island of Italian seed in South Africa, which leads to the thick valley, which leads to the Samati River, and we taught the local population of the local population of the Asian tomato and the mcini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they began to come.
We were surprised that in such a fertile valley, there were no agricultural agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank goodness we are here."
"Searst time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderfully in Africa is so great.
We had this gorgeous tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the epographs, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato was twisting and red, over the night, about 200 ninters came from the river and diked everything.
We said to the Himalayan tsunami, "Oh my God, the fistoo!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have farming here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so good at Italy in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French world did, and after I saw what they did, I became pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the nemle.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense that we've made to the lack of human beings.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a peer-bacological economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We have given the African continent a trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read your book.
You read from an African, what we've done.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionars, and there are only two ways that we deal with people. We suppress them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchical: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisal: I treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "b Cura," the boss.
I was joked when I read the book "Sall' Beautiful" by laughter. He said, most importantly, in economics, if people don't want help, they leave it alone.
This was the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, invited a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that is not neocolatial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people and invented a system called business promotion, where no one was ever initiated, no one is motivated, but you're going to be the CEO of the local passion, the servant of the local people, the trauma of becoming a better person.
What you do -- you keep your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put it together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in kitchiples.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends, we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like, what do you do?
The passion for the human growth is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important human being.
We're helping them find knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why not to get into a community and tell people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
Entrepreneurs have never been part, and they will never ever say public what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Designing has this light spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to public meetings.
We're working on one to do this, we've got to be producing a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the hospital worker who's sitting with you in the house, sitting in your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the means to transform your passion in a way that transform life.
I've tried this in Esperance, West Australia, I've tried it.
I was a Ph.D. student, trying to escape the about, the disdading disdomen, where we say others what they should do.
And so I walked all over the streets for the first year, and I had my first three days of customers. I helped him. He was a big fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth, and organized the fishermen came, and said, "You've helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers work together and I didn't sell these wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany, 60 cents, but to Japan for Sushi, 15 dollars. And then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them. Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects in one year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I keep the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- and the government says, "Please do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've been helping 40,000 companies at the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on to loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers in history, died at 96 years ago.
Peter's a graphic professor before he was busy with business. Peter Cochrane said, "Sanger is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the workforce.
So you build Christchurch, you can't know what the smartest human Christchurch is going to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to you.
You have to provide them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they'll come in.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the most cheier you've liked for tomorrow?
<unk>Typing, passionate people. They hated you.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- the calculated fossil fuels, the production, the manufacturing -- and all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open-knone realm of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in a sustainable way, to cure, to form, to transport, and to correspond to them.
The technologies are not there.
Who will invent this technology for green revolution? universities? Forget it.
The government? Forget it.
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York in 1860s.
In 1860 they came together and they created what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York. The conclusion was an unification: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows in the speed, they needed six million horses to kill the people, and it would be impossible to get the crap done with six million horses.
Because they were already in the crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that makes life warm from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive makers in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology had made the race. There were little small factories in the backyard.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, they have to be offered discretionion.
Otherwise, they're not coming and they're talking to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolutely, committed and passionate service.
and then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all needs to be able to do three things: to sell the capital company, to be great, to be the market market market, and to be enormous.
Do you guess?
We've never met a single person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care for money.
That's not what it doesn't exist.
This person was never born.
We've done research and we've looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have, only one: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 year-old entrepreneurs in Northeast, and we start giving them the lectures to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Autobiography. The task of the 16th-year-old students is to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons's Autography of how often he uses the word "I'm," and how often the word "we" is.
Never "I" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small professional background in cafes and bars. Their dedicated buddy, who will do for them, what someone here has done for this gentleman, who's talking about this epos. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do it." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting corporate facilitators to help them find the means and the means of the means. We've found that the wonders of the local population make the power of the local population that can be transformed, the culture and the economy of this community, only by the understanding of the passion, the energy, the imagination of the human.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be in Alice's wonderfulland.
So Penn State University asked me -- a Ph.D. for communications -- to try to connect courses in communication.
I was scared.
I'm really afraid. I'm afraid of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big books, and I don't trust them.
But when the conversation came along, he turned it like Alice, when she was pushing down to the pig's cell that he had a door to see a whole new world.
And I felt like I was talking to the students. I was amazed by the idea they had and wanted others to find these miracles.
I think to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy, environment, health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, then it's not going to go ahead. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their wonderful heritage.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
I want to show you a couple of ways that you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're engaging with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well, what?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only does your cheeks study, but also tell us that their cheeks, the material structure in our bones, are studying because it's important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And if you're going to describe what you're doing, then you're going to avoid the word "nothing"
Now, linguistic words are a barrier to understanding your mind.
I don't know if you could use "discovery and time" but why don't you just say "space and time," what is much more understandable for us?
And to make your mind understandable is not the same as they're at the level of their level.
As Einstein said, "Well, things just as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with compromise.
So a couple of things are thought about: examples, stories and analogies. That's how you can pull us into your worm.
And if you present your work, the dots go away.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "diction point?"
What happens when you look at somebody? One is getting stabbed, and those dots are the first one to your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits too much on the conversation that we're talking about in our brain, and that's why we're so excited about it.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more potent. It shows that the specific structure of the pigmentation is so robust that it was actually the inspiration for the typical design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple, simplified sentence where the audience, once it loses the thread, adjusts the thread, adjust the images and the graphics that also helps our other senses and make a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up this door and see the wonderland that celebrates science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to make a tight contact with the "Iran" in me, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
Now, look at your science and your preconceptions and your scientific review, these are the ones that are encoded by the relevance, so the audience is important, and they multiply the whole thing that you have with your incredible work: and that creates incredible perceptions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you have solved this equation, I'm really comfortable in this.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and provide a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can write a message with a cell phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song and you can get it in the sound cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1904, and I live in Berlin.
So let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see hundreds of thousands of people going out the road and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're wondering that all these people who were coming together and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. An Android, an Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and my cell phone and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.88 pages of information.
Brustular data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Recess has set up a policy.
This is a rule of law enforcement law enforcement.
This policy is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service service service service service in the entire country, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls who? Who's going to send an email?
Who is going to send a text message to whom?
And if you use a cell phone, where you're a cell phone.
All this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service company.
And everywhere in Europe, people got up and said, "We don't want that."
They said we don't want to have this reserve protection.
We want self-determin in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of whom said, "We don't want that."
And you can see tens of thousands of people flocking out on the streets of Berlin, saying, "Fause not fear."
And some people even said this could be a Stasi 2.0.
The agora was the head-bloodol police in East Germany.
And I also wonder, is this really working?
Can all of this information store over us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the German telecom, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, all of the information you've stored over me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get a right answer. Only a half Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's her plateing.
So I decided to put a court case against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German Telecom said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was a comparison with them.
I'm going to take the tag back what they all demand me to send information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court mandated that the E.U. Recession was a misleading law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD, this was what I did.
35.830 lines on information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My approach.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do about this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm asleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what's called the home conservation.
So with time online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and down.
You can take every step that I do, track.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to Köln, and how many calls I'm going to go.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about all of us.
First of all, it's just like, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a couple of times.
And then a couple of friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call you, and we have this huge network of communications.
But you can see people communicating with each other what time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who the leaders are the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a design plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who to whom to email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said earlier, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders were, that might have never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And not the case of the Ice Ocean.
Because today's national agencies and companies want to store so many information as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all the time.
But self-determin and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your persecutor, just because companies and state communities have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it very long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to struggle for self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: domestic intelligence, rapid restaurants, brkops.
So the city planners come together and they thought about changing the name of South Central, so that it represents something else, they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Ordinary stores, rapid restaurants, bride palms.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the Drivebys.
The great thing is that the Drive-thrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the necessary condition.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it is in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't catch that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative impacts that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I find that carriers buy and sell and sell as a carrier.
I see comshaking centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that must stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I'd had 45 minutes birthdays to get an apple that's not labeled with pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park plant park.
It's 45 feet in diameter.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to do it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to stay in."
And I decided to keep it in the same way.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, together, and we started to plant my food name and fruit trees, which is the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of executive group, composed of gardening from all the social layers and from all the city, and it's totally voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically assigned me a substitute, and said I need to remove my garden, the supply line became a seduction.
And I thought, "Okay, yeah, right?
A seductive set of mandate for growing food on a piece of land that you're completely not comfortable?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city Council and I talked to a member of Green Ground Oakland, and they made a petition on Change.org, and 900 signatures were successful.
We held the victory in the hands.
My town council even called and said they support it and love what we do.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most of the real estate in the United States in the possession of the city.
They have 67 square kilometers in the field.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should they not find it okay?
By planting a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my treasure message, I'm telling people to make their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing their own money.
See, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew up my sons there.
And I'm more comfortable to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Homework is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's rounding the walls, I'm going to fill lawns and plant equipment.
I'm using the garden, the soil, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my valves for this stuff.
You would be surprised what the ground can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden to become an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
They would wonder how children are affected by this.
So gardening is the most therapeutic and most bold act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you also get strawberry.
I remember when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my garden, and I came out and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not for all reason in the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just empowered me to do this. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Zum hell, no, I'm not afraid they're doing something.
And that's the road.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it had changed, even though, for a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people who came in and they did it, and they did all of these volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, babies eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they're not offered anything from it, if they're not shown how food and body impacts, they're blind, whatever you're going to do.
I see young people who want to work, but they're sitting in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that are for them, and that leads nowhere to them.
The gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these children to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire district of gardens, where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipping container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The great thing about sustainability is you have to stop it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and getting them the pleasure and the pride and the honor and the honor to experience when you build their own food, and when you open farmers' markets.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to be all of the environmental rebel, gangsters, gang gardeners.
We need to turn the picture of the sq.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gangster.
The gang is going to be a "mirlock, yeah?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're going to sit in the spot and want to make a meeting where you're talking about making some shit.
If you want to meet me, come with your knees, in my garden so that we can plant some shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "snollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "is more unfair politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher gave a better definition: "A Snollygoster is somebody who is striving for a foreign party, regardless of party, program, program, and his success, is achieved by the pure power of monumental arithmetic.
I have no idea what the manual is.
Something about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers were not allowed to wipe out exactly the same word of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was looking at the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to pursue, and he ended up having so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the phrase "so" as Brass." Many people think.
Brassy is a word for the English "to-shoo" in the middle.
But that's not true. It's back to a promotion of press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time that it has just reached independence.
And you could think about the question of, what you should call George Washington, the head of state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a popular nation?
and it was discussed in Congress for infinite, long.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-city George Washington, and other people, and the conservation of the poor of the United States of America.
Not that much.
Some people just wanted to call it king.
They thought it was preventable.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with boredom because this debate was three weeks.
I read the diary book of a U.S. novel book that constantly wrote, "I've thought about the same topic."
The reason for the waist and the boredom was that the representment house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want it.
King, and maybe even gives him ideas to follow his conclusion.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most comfortable, daunting titles that they could find.
This is a cover.
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only meant that somebody was complaining.
Something like the firing of a jury.
He had no longer been the size of the book "tomssory" or "all water."
Sometimes there were a senior presidential and government group, but it was really a misguided title.
That's why the Senate refused to leave it.
They said, "It's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy has to sign in and hit foreign carriers.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't stop.
Instead, you were supposed to be the name "dist" as a matter of being the "distist" is about being the case, but they were absolutely clear that they were not comfortable with their honest respect for the opinions and the methods of civil nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, that the state of the state of the attorial, it's not validable -- that the president and the other, the foreignmost, the United States, is
You can learn three interesting things from this.
First, and I think that's the best -- I've never really been able to figure out if the Senate ever really really really appreciated the name of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just hated the title. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something is temporary -- -- -- -- you'll wait 223 years later.
And third, and this is really important, and that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is not so humbling, right?
This has to do with the slightly more than 5,000 nuclear arms that it has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title size.
And so the Senate ended.
They got a respectful title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the meaning of self-interest -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations do a president have?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end of the day, the Senate and the representatives of the house lost because nobody feels humble when you're told you're the President of America now.
And that's the most important thing you can take away and that I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a Lip with about 50 rustle at the war of Moalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to wipe out my black Conclothy mammoth for a pair of brown leatherters and a firefighter rocket in the direction of the government regime that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I'd grown up with war, but next to Pyjama's party and football games and singing with racist Southeasts and heroist groups of Brazil, who had never met with communism and live in Afghanistan, and I knew what that meant.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm here to stand here, a inspired Afghans, Southeast of God Gnaden. An atheist and a radical political artist who's been living in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So there are a lot of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but personally I don't like color bridge bells. I want to make art that motivates the personality and informs authority and rewriting the reality and even using a kind of imaginative citizen to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- you know, the jihad that's going to force its jihad against communityists like "Pop Starting" and used violation and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihadiest first, when the parliamenthip went for a job and doing a choice campaign with the phrase, "Take me! I'm hungry."
And I'm trying to use this campaign to break these Mafiosi that are used as a national hero.
I want to go to the cause of corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rememures," where you're a police department, build a false control center on the streets of Kabul and putting cars on the streets of Kabul, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money to the name of the police department in Kabul, hoping that they would take us 100 of us.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become, I think, the Intermodical conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you could only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine the fur of indigenous Afghan dresss with a protective or multiple-tested wet and a new, co-friendly, soul-friendly,
And I'd like to see what a simple push from Kabul looked like between Kiplell's app with 1899 to create a dialogue about the fact that the current development institutions of developing nations have its origins in the past-thrational rhetoric about "The Del of the White Dine" to protect the brown man from themselves and maybe even a little too civil.
But for all these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, they can't be misrepresented.
But I do, because I have to because I need to because the geography of self needs.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I've been a model.
For 10 years, exactly.
I feel that now in the room, there's a very awkward tension that I should not have been carrying that dress.
Thankfully, I have a little more to change.
This is the first time someone is attracted to the TED stage, so you can appreciate the fact that they're happy to see that.
If a few women were really excited when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I'll read this later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
and not everybody has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me off, so don't do anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
A image is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to throw my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrong brine that I took two days ago to work, there are very few ways to change our utterance, and yet it's super-expicial -- a lot of impact on our lives.
Being fearless is for me to be honest today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a good white lady, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I'm always like, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and you might be wondering what this legacy is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, where we are biologically programmed, but as big, stiffy, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point. And maybe some fashion writers might say, "Halt. Naomi. Joan Smalls. Liu.
And first, I'm commenting your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU counted all the modules on the run, every single one that was being dated, and that of 677-tested modules were only only 27 or less unknown.
The next question I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model when I'm grown?"
And first I say, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja Conman's Cabin, which would be completely wrong, because then you'd be the first."
If they still say after this amazing upshar, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "She's my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the president of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meis.
To say that you want to become a model later, is like you want to win the Jackpot in the Lotto.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career path.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of a model of design, because unlike the heart surgeon, it can only be unfolding right now.
And when there's a photographer there, and the light is just there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a picture to run," now the leg first, beautiful, long, long, that arm goes back, this head is on the front, and you're moving forward, and you're just moving back, and you're going to see, you're going back up and see, you're going to see,
It looks something like this.
I hope it's less strange than it does in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and have a life and have a few jobs, you can't tell much more. If you want to be President of the United States, but in the lifetime, "10 years of underwear," you'll be looking at weird.
The next question I'm often asked is, "Who is going to beat all the photos?"
And yes, pretty much all of the photos are stored, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was the very first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my period at the time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal right now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months earlier, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this movie.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party a few days ago, a magazine party for French birdgy.
This is me with the football team and the V-A magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you'll see these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, Hairstylists and remixers and photographers and Stylists and all their fellow pilots and their pre-engineering. They're not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Well, did you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-m-m-m-minted gloves that I can't wear, except just right, but the things that I get for free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and she walked over a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took me a "Excuse me, Mr. Ww. Wilson," and we could go on.
I got these free things about my appearance, not because of my personality, and there are people who pay a lot of money for their appearance and not for their personality.
I live in New York, and I live from 140,000 teenagers who have been shot and smiled in the last year, 85 percent of black and Latino and mostly young men.
It's only 177,000 young male male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Am I stopped?
But, "How many times am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
And what I found in this talk is that 53 percent of all the women in the United States don't like their body, and that number is 78 percent, if they turned to 17.
The last question I've ever asked is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and gliny hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backstage, we'll give a answer that might be given to this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never said before the camera, what I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure.
And I'm unsureful because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happier if I had thin legs and gliny hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool puppies and they're the ones that are probably unsafe women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to get a very honest balance, because on one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to turn myself in here and say, "I got all the benefits of a stack that was being messed into my favor," and it doesn't feel very good at me, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was very difficult to really open up a heritage of oppression for gender and race when I'm one of the greatest supplementters of it.
But I'm also happy and honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've done this here before 10 or 20 years or 30 years of time, and my career has passed over, because I wouldn't probably tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I paid college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misguighs and failures.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother that had come to life in exile: "Son, poor Gaddafi Resist. Giech.
But never become something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been now almost two years since the Libyan revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass mass mass destruction in both those in the Tunisian revolution.
I joined with many other Libyes, inside and out of the outside, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, licensed women and men stood in the first row, the end of the regime, the Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have proven plausible mutant by placing on the brutally brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They have shown a very strong sense of solidarity, from the far east, across the far east, all the way to the south.
Finally, after six months of brutal war and nearly 50,000 deaths, we were able to free our country and to reduce the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a great burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the basis of movement.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannical regime has both destroyed infrastructure and also the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I knew how many other women in the world have helped rebuild the civil society of Lybacia. We asked for a predatory and unchanging transition to democracy and national justice.
Near to 200 organizations, while they were launched, immediately after Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybia, and with very unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to the subject of achievement, human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the leadership platform of Liby Women, a leadership movement of different life-world life, whose goal is to be publicized for the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and for our right to equal governance in the democracy and peacebuilding.
In the general elections, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more intense polarized, a environment which was shaped by the selfish political politics of dominance and execution.
I led an initiative to the Peace Continuum of Murean women to achieve a regulated choice law, a law that any citizen, no matter what the back of the world should be, to vote for and to run, and most importantly, to confront a relationship between male and female candidates on vertical and vertical and accurate and narrow and so to make a constant score.
At the end, our initiative was over and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the national jurisdictions in the first elections since 52 years.
But it was very, very clearly, the history of elections and the entire revolution, was about <unk> because every day we started making new news about violence.
We went to the marriage of the Sapties over the ancient mosques and Sufi leaders.
On another morning, we got a message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack.
And then another morning, the wounded victims were signed by the army's army.
And really every day, we're facing the sovereignty of the militians and their ongoing advances against the human rights and their abortive of laws and laws.
Our society is formed by a revolutionary human state, polarized and distant from the ideals and principles -- liberty, dignity, social justice -- that they had at first.
Intolerance, decay and revenge became the icon of the <unk>anason<unk> of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our pressing list and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to make sure that as a nation, we have made false choices and false decisions.
We set our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or safety in Lybias.
Did the hard-tist and change between female and male officials lead to peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate and dominate the dominance of dominance and the permander, both of men and women?
Maybe the women weren't the only thing to miss, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the purpose.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus as it needed to have elections that ultimately strengthen the polarization and reproduction.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it needs the numerical, quantitative, the embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting on behalf of anger and ask for a day of revenge.
We need to start acting on behalf of sympathy and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just appreciate the next values, but also it's also a problem: that instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, rather than execution.
These are the ideals that need to be rid of a war-lipped lybia to get peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in this alchemy, it's about the relocation of feminine and masking view.
That's the real cold.
And we need to do this in existential terms before we do it socio-Indically.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam" -- peace, "is the word of the Good God, cailed."
The word "raheem" again known in all the abrally-an traditions has the same Arabic root as the word "rairhem" and symbolizes the maternal feminine that surrounds all humanity from the man's and the female, all of the tribes and all of the peoples.
And just as the mother's mother's case growing in his embryo, it's completely fed the basic nature of compassion.
And so we were told, "My Gnade is all about things."
And so I was told, "My Gnade was precribed in front of my gree."
I think that all of us will be the revenge of the GIN.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up in a way to treat the song "nord."
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world out there, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until a changeable moment.
At age seven, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I had never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from the sister of a colleague of mine.
And she said, "If you did this, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're dying soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
And I was about to go to the station station and see something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A bleeding woman was lying on the ground, and a her mother was crushed in her arm was bleeding helpless in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were all so busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-1990s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were killed to victims, and many more others survived because they ate grass, and they ate frogs and the trunks.
So electricity waste has become more and more common so that at night it's all too bad for me except for the lights of China on the other side of the tag that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite photograph of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the Venro, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very scary and allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of deaths.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that during the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought I would be separated from my family for a very short time.
I never thought it would take 14 years to get back to work.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea what life would be as a North Korean refugee, but soon I learned it's not only extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in silence that my true identity could fly in, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was realized when I was caught by the Chinese police police police and sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be a Northan woman, so they tested my Chinese convictions and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
If anything unnatural is, I could be imprisoned and biased.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the interrogation, a senior official said to the other one, "This was a false mess.
She's not a Northan woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are employing foreign messages called Ayl, but many are caught by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they got caught, they finally got released because of immense international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are released to North Korea, where they are tortured, imprisoned or imprisoned in public.
Although I was lucky enough to escape, many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle for survival.
After they've learned a new language and found work, their world can be put on their heads in a moment.
And after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
In South Korea, I was a bigger challenge than I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I've also seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've become very divergent, due to 67 years of division.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northanan father?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't get very easy, I had a plan.
I prepared for the show at university.
Just as I became more successful in my new life, I got a shock call.
North Korean authorities started the money I sent my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to relocated to a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go through an incredible distance on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself on the way to the Northan border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run them on more than 2,000 miles from China and then to Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed, and said they were greeting, and I was her lover.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We've managed to get it to the low-ranking border, but I've had to almost go and use all my money to get the boundary control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family has been imprisoned because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and paid cash, my family was released within a month, but shortly, my family was re-inhabited in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the greatest disdomen in my life.
I had done everything to help my family get to the liberty, and we were so close, but my family was arrested just before the Southern Cyan embassy.
I went and forth between the immigrants and the police department, and I was desperately trying to clean up my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back and pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And the guy asked me, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger was looking for it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without lousy, he went to a bank machine, and he paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
And I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger symbolized me as a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope of the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back in South Korea, but the freedom to gain is just one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they arrive in a new country, they start out with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, the professional education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world because many of us still remain in contact with family victims, and we're going to send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I hope I would want to make a lasting North Koreans to succeed, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreanans all over the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to have one request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it uncomfortable, and he shares it unsconditional.
It's not stupid. It's not paying attention to the skin color.
He's not caring about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to think about words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: How little we know about the mind and how wonderfully amazing the unknown.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He's got an absolutely unfinished memory.
But he has a selective act.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate cater, but he remembers every song on my iPod, talking about four of the time he was the first episode of the teapleties on my arm, and he was pushing the Lady Gagas's birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and understood.
But what motivates my heart and empowered my soul was that even though that was the case, although they were not seen as usual, that only one could mean they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autiverseism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that affects social communication and learning and physical skills sometimes.
It's a different form of each individual, so Remi is different from the same as Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes in a new person is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing incidents in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm encounter autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He was a lot of a joke.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and reorganized in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, putting the washing machine and eating everything that was under him.
And as he got older, he became different, and the differences became apparent.
But behind the ramath and the hustle, and the one who was never going to see hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been lied.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normal, the beauty that we have is the differences that give us, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be like you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it. And in all of us, honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change die in the moment that we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been filled with awe and curiosity, and this photo on a project made an apple and a catapath of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we're not seeing the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create a timeline of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look outside of our viewpoints and see outside of our view, or not even an <unk>-ray in our body and really ask what we mean with "memag."
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it into a billionth of a second -- these are several femtoseconds -- I'll create a package of photons that are barely a millimeter wide, and this photon pack, this project, is going to move in the speed of light, and, as I said, a million times faster than a normal new project.
So, if you take this project, take this photo sample pack and shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So, remember, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotone -- as long as the light to go back this lane -- but I'm trying to make this video take about 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't funded this research.
So, this is a film that happens a lot, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, is going to enter the bottle with a photon pack that starts to move through and eventually break inside.
Part of the light, it's going out the table, and you see that the result of the waves.
Many of the photons eventually achieve the delusion of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that's going on in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflections are focused on some of the tip of the bottle after a few images.
Now, if you take a common project and let it go back the same track and slow the video back by 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project of performance.
And what about a little still-time photograph?
You can see again how these waves of the table, the Tomate and the wall upside down in the back.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed to me as if nature was painting this picture, each of which was a femto image, but of course our eye is a composted image.
But if you look at this Tom's Tomate again, you'll see that when the light goes over the Tomate, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom's coming up and the light jumps in her and comes back after a few billionth of a second.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is installed in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you could go into a supermarket and see if a fruit is mature, without touching them at all.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with a very short amount of moisture time, you have very little light, but we're more targeted a billion times faster than your very shortest amount of waste, so you're not getting light at all.
So what we're doing is we're going to send this project, this photo pack, a million-and-a-half-dimensional, and draw it back and forth with very clever synchrony synchrony, and we're going to combine these gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superhero: to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to put some light on the door.
It will be repired, going into the room, and part of it will be reflected back on the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could exploit that more repetitive lightbulb.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually done it already.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall, a puppet is hidden, and we're going to be able to break the light on the door.
After our paper was published in the International Communications, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light project and it's going to be tapping back to this wall, and this photons packs in all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will then break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light, and then a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but most interesting, they'll be very different at the very close time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique capacity.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And so of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the one that's hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is what distance is.
By making a laser so we can take a laser, can we record a raw image, that -- as you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but then we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light-torns, then we can see that hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit more to do before we can do this in the lab in practice, we could build cars that avoid collisions and detect what's behind the curve, or we can search for the dangerous levers of survivors, by looking at light through open windows, or we can build endcopes that look deep in the body around the right-flush, and also around the river.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's very challenging why this is really a web call for scientists to think about Femtoemto photography, because a new sculptural approach could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist, himself has become an art, an art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we're gathering every time, not just the scientific processing process. We can also create a new form of computer photography, with paint, and color recognition, and we can only look at the wave between those things that are not even beyond the time.
But it's also a bit fun here.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move towards us.
What's going on here?
And it turns out that we're almost in the speed of light, weird effects, and Einstein would have seen this image incredibly.
The order of events in the world will appear in the camera in reverse order, in order to counter-exstruct the context of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So whether it's for photography to focus around corners or to create a new model for medicine or new exhibits, since our invention has been open-ended and detailed in our website, hoping that the "pierymers and the creative and the research community will tell us that we should stop to step up on the megapels of xenels, and start to correct the next, the next, the next, the next, to be able to be able to be able to be
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor in the street so many of the discussions are not passed over, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and tents and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is reassured by the vast osteas that have been loving and scratching drunks and drees and shading shadows. I trust a city where there are always music.
I think every time anyone never ever never sees, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the left-off parts in America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I could get it, and I thought about it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpectedly.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great grateful gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that matter me now in life.
But it's hard for me to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose and forget about what's really important in the daily lives.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a giant blackboard and I wrote with a velotape of the gaps: "In my wake, I want to die, I want to -- anyone who's coming back, a piece of chalk, to think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely filled up, and it grew.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"First I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I want to die before I die, I want to be more complete on the International Recession line."
"First I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"First I die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to die before I die, I want to live on "weak."
"First I die, I want to keep it in my arms."
"Fould I die, I want to be somebody's cavalry."
"First I die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and the dreams of the people brought me to laugh, to cry and to moan me during the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and in a new and elaborate way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of secret messages that their community wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction kit, and now in the world like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Argentina and other other other walls.
We've shown how much power our public spaces have when we have the opportunity to rise our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right look and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often being stopped talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation to death is one of the things that strengthen us most.
The idea of death illustrates the way life works.
Our common places are the best things that we can do as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and their fears and stories, people around us can't just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm looking at this on a very ambitious math. I'm a very special problem for anyone who's been looking at the most aggressive math, is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try to explain to you what I do today.
So dancing is one of the most human activities.
We're thrilled to see the wrestling ballwaset and beers mating as you'll see.
Now, for ballet, there are an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill and skill, and possibly a fundamental determination that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly break out this extraordinary ability. It also makes me feel like my beloved Jan Strival, who was a ballet failure at his time.
Over the years, you've made a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the damaging symptoms like weaknesses, killings, killings, and other others living, that cause this disease to detect objective cure the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there is a cure if we have an objective measure that we can answer that question.
In trouble, there's no biomarkable for Parkinson's disease and other brain disorders, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing to do is to have this 20-minute test test at neurologist.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies, it's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a lone tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't have to be a corporate hospital.
It's 300 percent, by the way, to investigate the neurological department.
So I want to suggest a unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a sense, virtuose like my Iranian rituals.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal sound.
This is what happens in a healthy state, when someone is creating speech sounds. We can look at it as a mood ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs if we make sounds, and we have all the genes for it.como2, for example.
And how ballet needs a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn to talk.
And by the way that you're pointing, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and so the way the limbs are affected by the mood organ of Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom note, you can see an example of irregular vocal delusions.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Regoror, weakness, perseverance.
The language is even becoming more wiser and wisden and twil and so that's an example of the character.
Now, these impacts can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision analytical data, combined with new machine learning that's so advanced now, we can actually tell where someone lies in a spo-count between disease and health, just because of the vocal sounds.
How can these tests be measured in clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test of neurologists.
Not so much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are accurate. They're not exactly the right tests that are done by experts.
So they can be done by their own.
They're very fast, they're at the maximum level of 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
So we can do these amazing goals.
We can reduce logistics difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to make routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from over-reviewing observation.
We can do inexpensive massage for clinical trials and can actually do the research of the entire population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's G.S. Constitution.
With Aculab and patient'sLike, we want to take a very high number of voices worldwide to have enough seed data for the investment of these goals.
We have reputation numbers that are accessible to a billion people on the planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease can call a cheap to leave a few-cent-map-a-half-hour recordings. I'm very familiar with joy that we've reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, say 10,000 people, you can tell who is healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is the patient in the call-ed-up call needs to tell if this person has Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you may not get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in various circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we're going to turn them out to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
Right now, your 86 percent accuracy is true?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done such fantastic work -- has shown now that it's also working on the cellular network that allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
That means people can -- people can call the phone and do the test. People could call it to Parkinson's disease, call their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya at the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the back, you see the cows of my father, and the behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in the south, branched in. That means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night. I woke up in the morning and found her dead. It was awful. It was our only Buft.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we came together with our animals and the open land of the sky, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I've learned how to hate lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our lovede. They're also adored for this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park there's only so few lions.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years of his father's cows. That's what it was for me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Beus fear of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but it would help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to use a bird's disease.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they see the bird's records and they go back. But the next time they come and they come, they say, the thing doesn't move, that's still here.
And they reach out and kill our livestock.
One night, I woke up the rubble. I walked around with a slack in the hand, and this time the lions didn't get caught.
Beers fear light, which is moving.
I had an idea.
And I've been working all day in my room, and I've even taken the new radio from my mother, and I've almost taken my mom's new radio. The day it's gotten me around. But I've learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a driver of a motorcycle, and that suggests if you want to turn right or left. It's bright.
And I made a switch to turn the lights out and off.
This is a little snail from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is integrating the battery, the battery is providing electricity to the right-player. I call it a transformer.
And the right-playing power is bright.
You can see that the eelels show outwards, because of the lions there.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights blink, and the lions believe I'm walking around the rubble. And I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our home, and since then, we've had no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've spent seven houses in the neighborhood carrying lights and doing really well.
My idea is now used all over Kenya, including for other predators like hymen or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from the rivers.
My invention helped me a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is dedicated to fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in there, where there's no other, and I'm showing the people how to use them.
I was just a boy from the savanna who was serving his father's cows. I saw planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of the day!"
And here's me.
I was allowed to embark on an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to hunt lions. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can live together, side by side, with the lions, without the argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you've got this scholarship now. Yes.
They work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electrical fence. An electrode fence?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- yeah, I've tried it a little while, but I've given the attempt to go back because I got a blow.
All the time, Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you on every step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I was old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite paintings, and I didn't do one of them.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting was thought of.
To be honest, most of them were shot from random-tested tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture that I held my daughter on her first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57th and five.
And so, one year later, we went back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this goes from ...
When my daughter's third birthday came up and said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do it a father-daughter dance to keep the ritual going on?"
At the time, we started asking for the new tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to take a whole stranger to get his camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately nobody has ever been stalking with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day, so that a five-year-old could understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a given moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us in October a week to keep time and change the time we're coming from year to year, not just physically, but to reflect in everything.
Because although we're always doing the same image, our perspective of time changes as it's going on, as it's reaching new milestone, I can see life with their eyes as it does with everything, and how it sees.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something we appreciate and expect for the next year.
Last time we travel, we walked a walk, and suddenly it remained as if it were, it showed up on a red brand on a dollshake that they had learned as a little kid in the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years old at that point.
She said she remembers her holding the heart of her chest when she saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks up in New York because she really wants to go to New York because she wants to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like in you, but apart from those 15 pictures, I'm not on a family photo.
I'm always the one who makes this picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come to the image and tell someone, "Would you like to make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 27.38, 58.2/34.9/22.5/14.6 (BP=0.958, ration=0.959)
