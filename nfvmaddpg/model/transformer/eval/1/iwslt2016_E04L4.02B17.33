When I was 11 years old, I was a morning from the glut of the picity.
My father heard about his little, absolute radio show the BBC.
He saw very happy about what was very unusual, because it was mostly popular to the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!
I didn't know what it meant, but it really did my father, very happy.
"You can go to a right school," he said.
This morning, I'm never forgotten.
A right school.
The Taliban was tracking power in Afghanistan when I was six, and I was married to go to school.
So I'm going to leave five years after a boy and my older sister who didn't have to go back to a secret school.
It's just how we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to predict where we went.
We're going to put our books in the car, so it looked like we'd just go to the fly.
We've been in a house where there were 100,000 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a very, but it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that our lives were responsible: teachers, students and our parents.
And again, the class had to be caught for a week, because the Taliban had been shot.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to be aware of us?
Did you know where we live?
We were scared, but we didn't want to go to school.
I had a great fortune in a family where education became more important and daughters.
My grandfather was far away in his time.
A sub-in-in-in-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an
My mother was trained to be a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the prison, only to move our house to school and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- the first thing that was ever given in his family, ever a education.
It was always clear that his children would get a education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as much greater risk to send his children to school.
I know it's just that I'm so frustrated in the Taliban, and I'm so frustrated by our lives, from the unconcy and the reconability of ignorance.
I was really happy to give my father. But my father said, "Look, I can lose you in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be cut out in the war.
But one thing is going to always stay, which is what's in here, and even if we're going to pay our blood for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- -- you want to give yourself?"
Today, I'm about 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my women have a higher age than the high school, and if my family didn't have been so much so much for my education, I would have been able to have one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today as a very honest one of the New Guinea.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was beaten by his family because he's given his daughters to send their school to the first one who was being sent to me.
He's not just about my education, but also I was the first woman, and I'm a woman who's driving it through the car through Seattle.
My family thinks to me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm a global national worker for 1010, a global campaign for education for women.
So I've helped, MALA, who is the first and maybe the only public school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school school is still less likely for girls.
It's wonderful to see how students are in my school with a great repertoire of all of them.
And to see how their parents and fathers are in their own way, as my parents, despite all the time, and to the rest of all the time.
As Mary. That's not really his name, and I can't show his face, but Mary is a father who was a student.
A month ago, his daughter was on the home of MOLA in her village, and she's the death of a bomb that only took a few minutes.
When he went home, the phone will send him a voice and a voice to him if he took his daughter back to school, she would try to try to try again.
He said, "Tay me now, if you want to go to the future of my daughter because of your old and personal ideas."
What Afghanistan is, so I realized something that is often going to be on the West: the most of us have the success that the success of the most of us, is a father who is aware of his daughter, and that is also the threat that it's also going to be success.
It's not necessarily called our mothers who play a critical role in our success.
They're often more likely to be replicated and more likely to be a very popular future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, as a society in Afghanistan.
At the Taliban, only a hundred million girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But now, in Afghanistan, over three million girls.
Afghanistan is represented by America, like this.
Americans recognize how safe changes are.
I'm afraid that changes are not about the long-term and changing the United States's population.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them, they can also find a very promising future and a very long-term change.
Afghanistan is for me to be a country of hope and the unconcessable opportunities, and remember every day, the girls who go to the <unk>MLA.
It's just like me, they have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as a living life -- my life became seven years ago, which was a young man in Africa.
From 1977, 1977, I see it's a young -- not -- I have in Mexico, Kenya, Kenya, Europe, Europe, Europe and Europe and Brazil, and Brazil, in the technical projects with African countries.
I've been working for a Italian New York, and every single project that we've done on the legs, and I've failed.
I was really scared.
I thought, 21 years ago, we thought that Italy is good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything that we did.
Our first project that my first book called "Rad" was inspired to be a one that we wanted to show people in Italy, how food is being built.
We came to Italian mining in South America, in this cigar, which is going to bring to the Samian, and we've also trained the local population of the local and the French and the Asian and the Molas and the C.
Of course, the local interest had absolutely interest, so we've been able to work for work, and sometimes they're starting to go into it.
We were amazed that there was a very dense agriculture.
But instead of asking why they're not built, we just said, "God, thank you that we're here."
"Tight time to save people's Sania's people's life."
Of course, everything is wonderful in Africa.
We had this super-tatric soup. In Italy, they were so big in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the green and red, there were about 200 pars from the river and all the things.
We said to the Sananan, "Oh God, the pestah!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
Why did you tell us?" "You never ask us."
I thought it was just known in Italy in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the English did. After the French. And then I saw what she was doing.
We're at least the Nil.
They should see the fear -- you should see the misconcy that we don't have any of the most fundamental African people.
They should read the book "The Aah"""" Oahuo, she's a re-in-profit scientist.
The book was published in 2009, in 2009,.
We've given the African continent a trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been made.
Just read your book.
You're reading from a African, you've been able to see what we've been doing.
We are Western people, the Colombianists, the mission, and there are only two species, like us to deal with people. We're a non-cococic, or we're a non-cococic.
Both words are from the Latin rule, which means "tit".
But they have two different aspects.
Unconce: I'm going to make any other culture, when they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patusus: I'm going to make any other culture when they were my brother.
That's why white people in Africa, "The boss," the boss.
I became a bit more, when I read the book "Tear" "Tear""". He said, especially in the economic development, if people don't want to want to help them, they're going to go in a quiet.
That should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
Today, Mr. Snowden, who's been doing this conference, a ship on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that is not a non-fatatic?
When I was 14 years old, I decided to respond to people, and I decided to use a system called a company that never never gets a little bit, never someone will be trained, but you will have a local leader, the local community, the family, the dream of a better person.
What you do -- you're going to hide the mouth.
You never have a community with ideas, you're going to put together with a local house.
We don't work from office.
We're going to meet in the cafeteria. We're going to meet us in a po-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-m-h-h-h-h
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to find friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important is passion.
You can give someone a idea.
If this person doesn't like you to do it?
The passion for its own growth is the most important.
The passion for your own is the most important human humanity.
We help them find knowledge, because nobody can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this failure, why instead of going to come to a community and tell people what they should do, why don't we hear them? But not in community.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community-making.
entrepreneurs never have a full of interest, and they never say what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
Recessing has this light.
The most popular people in the community don't know because they never never seem to be able to put public meetings.
We work to do one of those things to do this, we have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has been created.
This is the house of the company who is a public worker that you're sitting in your house, in your kitchen and the cafeteria, help you find the control of your passion in a kind of passion in life.
I've done this in the field, West Cup, trying to do it.
I've been a scientific time, and I tried to stop the unconric, where we say other things that they should do to come out.
And so I went through the first year and I had the first three days in my first two days. I helped him. He took him a garage, he was a family, he helped him to sell him to a restaurant, and then we went to a restaurant in a restaurant, and then they said, "You could help us help us help us help us help us help them help.
I helped these five fish together, and they didn't work with this wonderful tuna in Calia to sell 50 cents, but to Japan to go to S<unk>11,000 dollars. And then they said, "Hey, we've helped us help them help them help them.
In a year, I had 18,000 projects. The government came to me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very, very difficult.
I'm hearing the mouth and listen to them."
So -- -- -- -- so the government says, "Do you take it again."
We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've been working 40,000 companies in the process.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be stuck in loneliness.
Peter, one of the best companies in history, died with 600 years ago.
Peter is an artist who was involved with companies. Peter Hillis said, design is actually a nonprofit society with a society and economics."
Playing is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christy to know what the most vulnerable human being in the order of the sex of their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get a place.
You have to give them a secret and privacy. You have to help them, and they will come into it.
In a community of 10,000 people, we'll get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 million people, the intelligence and passion?
What you've already been looking at in most of this talk tomorrow?
<unk>Audience, passionate people. They've been careful.
I want to say that entrepreneurs is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- unconable fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly we have systems that are not sustainable.
The cure engine engine is not sustainable.
The recononation of the unconcy is not sustainable.
We need to look at seven billion people in sustainable ways, to cure, build them, and we can turn them into them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will make this technology for the green revolution? universities? Don't you know?
The government? Do you know!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a kind of a preconciist magazine in many years ago.
There was a group of experts who invited to talk to the future of New York City in 1870.
In 1870, they came together and they put together in 100 years, which would happen in the city of New York. The conclusion was an absolute state: New York City would not exist in 100 years.
Why? You saw the curve on the surface, and they said, if the population grew up in this speed, they needed six million sheep to get paid, and it would be impossible to get the smoke with six million eggs.
Because they went in the hot.
18777 billion technology, you see the living life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1960, there was 100 dollars in the United States -- 100 dollars.
The idea that another technology had done, there was little factories in the jungle.
Doody, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of them has to be trained by the first.
They're not going to come and talk to you.
So next, you have to give them absolute, and you have to give them a passion, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurs.
From the smallest to the largest company, all of us have to do three things: the cost of selling the drug that has to be a commercial market, the financial and financial law.
Do you imagine?
We never met a single person that can make something like this, sell it, sell it to money.
It doesn't exist.
This person never been born.
We've been working research, and we've looked at 100 percent of the world -- Steve, the Grandma, the Edian, the FBI, the software, the new companies, Google, Berlin.
There's only one thing that has all the successful companies in the world, only one of them has been founded by one person.
Now we teach 12-year-old entrepreneurs in North America, and we start to share the first two sides of Richard Bransics. The task is the first 12-year-old lady, and the first 12-year-old Tolas, and so often, in Richard Cocus, he's often used to use the word "The word" and how often as often as often as a word "The word"
Never yet "I'm a "a" and 32 times."
He was not alone when he started.
Nobody started a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the CEO who have a small set of managers, in the cafeteria, and the T.C. and the people who are going to do for them, who are willing to be done for this gentleman, who is saying, "What's going to be able to have a community.
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Do you know, I'm like to find someone for you?"
We're using communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are helping them to help them to help people and people, and we found that the miracle of the government of the local government and the society, the culture of the community, and the community, can only change the passion, the passion of their collective and their imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've been interested in how it must be, Alice in the miracle forest.
The University of State University asked me -- a -- a -- for communication, to put together in communication, in communication.
I was scared.
The right fear. Because of those students with their large brains and their large books and their large, no words.
But as it started, he took me the conversation, he was like Alice, when she looked down to the car and put a door to a new world.
I felt like I was talking about the students, and I was amazed about the idea that they had found, and I wanted to find that other miracle in the country.
I think to open this door, it has to have a great communication.
We need to really need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environmental health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to be going to be going to be open. I think it's not going to be a policy in our responsibility than the academic sciences.
But these great conversations are not happening if our scientists and engineers don't let us ask us a miracle in their country.
So scientists and engineers, please, let's put us back.
I want to show you some insights about how you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're working with you, and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer us is, and guess?
Does you know why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that their pars are looking at, but it tells us that your parsy structure in our bones, because it's important to understand, because it's important to treat the polia and to treat.
And if you show the one that you're doing, you're going to be diagnosed in risk.
They're a symbol of understanding of your mind.
And you might even use your "cit" and even in time, but why don't you just say "Jeopardy" and time," which is much more difficult for us?
We're trying to make your thoughts to make it easy, not the same thing that you're going to take off.
As Einstein said, "Hoo the things that might be as possible -- but not easier."
You can tell us something about your scientific field without investing.
Some things are about to consider, examples, stories and texts, so that way, you can put us into your heads.
And if you're looking at your work, then we're going to take the numbers away.
Have you ever wondered why it's called "The point?"
What happens if someone is going to be a different? Another one is going to be once before, and with these first dots, the first one of your audience.
One slide like this is not just boring, but it's also a very hard part of the idea of our brain, and it's very quickly about it.
This example of Eie Johnson's Law is much more effective. It shows that the cognitive structure is so efficient that it was actually the inspiration for the design of the design of the design of the design.
The trick here is to use a single sentence, just to use the audience, if it can be able to lose the screen, and the images that are also replicated our senses and the other senses, and it's a very slow sense of what the understanding of what it is.
These are just a few steps that help us open this door and see the miracle in the country that science and technology.
And there's the engineers I've been taught to teach myself to make the "The World" in my own hand, I want to make all of this equation.
And you see, from your science and your scientific points, you can get this kind of, and you know, the audience says, which is important, and you know, the passion that you have, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
So scientists and engineers, if you've solved this equation, I'm really sure to focus on it.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can see a crime in the country in Syria.
So with a cell phone, you can start a message and start a replicated in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get a little bit of the sound and famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1996, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this time in the city.
You can see how thousands of people go to the street and put it back.
We're in the fall of 1998, and we're going to imagine that all these people who were coming to the changes, and we'd ask them to change, a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Don't take it up.
Take your cell phone, take it up!
Don't take it. A Android, a baseball, wow.
These are many. Almost every one is a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35777 points of information.
Pust data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2011, the E.S. has a line on the summer.
This is a line of the law of the Defense Recessal.
This is a line that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service in the entire Europe, has to store a range of anti-based system.
Who who's saying? Who's going to send a email?
Who's going to send a text?
And if you're using a cell phone where you're.
All of these information will be sold for about six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet phone.
And everywhere, people are coming out and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to store this law.
We want self-zero-dimensional age, and we don't want to say that the phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, journalists who all said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how thousands of people on the street, and they said, "Don't be afraid."
And some of them said, this could be a pistola.
The Stan was the pistian in the Southwest.
And I also ask myself whether it really works.
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them to come out and put all the information that you've already made me over.
And I asked them, and she said, "No answer. Just a more, very low-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that you're doing.
So I decided to put a court on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the Deconceian, no, we're going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to leave the waving to what they all put together to me.
Because in the meantime, the federal Recession decided that the introduction of the E.S. was based on the German rightness.
So I got this ugly brown to a CD.
And on the CD, this was what it was.
35777 points on information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge record. My hand.
But then I realized a while, and I realized that's my life.
These are six months of my life in this stage.
So I was a little bit skeptical, so what do I start to start with this?
Because you see where I'm sitting in night, where I'm sitting in the night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to do it.
Because I want people to show what the law enforcement means.
So with time online and open data, I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom down and zoom down, you can go back and back.
You can take every step I'm doing, and let's take it back.
And you can see how I went from Frankurt, with the train to Burt, and how many calls I'm going to go.
All of this is possible by this information.
It's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, it's just like my wife and she calls me and she calls me, and we talk to some time.
And then I'm going to call you some friends and call them another.
And after a while, you call them and you call this huge network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other, when they go to bed.
You can see anything.
You can see the central characters that are about who the leaders are.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design, as you can use society, because you know who you talk to who someone who is going to send a email, all of you can have access to this information.
And this information is being sold for six months to Europe to two years.
As I said, at the beginning, we're going to imagine that all these people in the street, all these people in the middle of the jungle were in the mid-10-Fi.
And the Stah, who had been able to know who was in the experiment, and if the pans knew who the leaders were already, then it might never happen.
The case of the Berlin wall would have never been published.
And yet, of course, the case of the sacred rock.
Because today, national agencies and companies want to store so many information, how they can get us, online and online.
They want to track our lives, and they want to store all the time.
But self-esteem and life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-esteem today.
They have to fight for each day.
So if you go home, you're going to tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not the old.
If you go home, you're going to tell your CEO, just because companies have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, you're going to ask your phone company to get information that you've got to do.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight self-dimensional age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central Africa.
This is South Central Carolina: Searce, rapid-time, the Tield, the T.C.
So the city plan is to change the name of South Central Central Africa so it's about something, it's changing it in South Los Angeles, whether something changes in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Songy-tatformance, rapid-time spaces, the air spaces.
Like 27, 27 million Americans, I live in the food of the rural Southwest, the home of Dr. and the Sananian.
The sad thing is that the Dr.S. is that the Dr. is that the people kill more people than the Hanans.
People die in South Central Los Angeles, in unconciable diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in the Sama River, which is about 15 miles.
I couldn't let it go with the other.
And I wondered how to feel, if you wouldn't have access to healthy food, if you can go from the house, the negative impact that has the power of food system that has been able to have in your neighborhood.
I'm going to get a pow, and I'm sold to use as a tool.
I see the poetry centers of the sky, like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And then I didn't have a little bit of a five-minute-minute-minute-term-term-up-up-to-t-diving to get a apple that is not based on the non-catial.
So I took a food bike in my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park.
It's 45 feet in about three feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to have to do it.
So I think, "T. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to hold it in.
And I decided to put it in the way.
So I came and my group, the T.L.L. And we started to build my food, and we've started to plant the food, and we've got to plant the whole program, the whole motor program.
We're a kind of super-touch, we're building from all social parts of the city, and all the city, it's completely open, and all of which we're doing is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else has a chance.
The city came to me and he was a completely uncited, and he said that I have to put my garden, which was going to be a complete,
And I thought, "Do you know, right?
A common deal with food consumption on a piece of country that is completely completely right?
And I thought, "T. Give him."
Because this time it wouldn't go to the time.
The T.A. Times got a story about this. Steve LRR. and talked about the city and a member of MOE. You've got a bump on the Rump.org. We've been successful with 12,000 rules.
We thought the battle was in the hands.
My city was actually called, and he said they support it and love what we do.
So, really why should they do that?
T.A. There's the most of the high-tatial spaces in the city.
They have a hundred miles on the Pareway.
These are 207 Central Park.
It's enough to plant 45 million power plants.
Why should they find that right?
By growing, you'll get 1,000 times -- 10,000 seeds.
So with green, green, you get a dollar and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my bossal, I'm saying people want to grow their own food.
His own food to fly as your own money.
Look, I have a legacy in South Central Africa.
I grew up there. I've been growing my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this kind of ignorance that has been made by other people, and I'm going to turn my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
The art is my art. I'm wearing my art.
It's just like a graffiti artist who's going to put the walls, I'm going to put my lawns and air.
I use the garden, the Earth, the way that a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my own, for this stuff.
They were surprised what the ground can do, all the way that if you use it as a keyboard.
You can't imagine how amazing a sun is, and how they're touched.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my inner spaces was taken for education and the connection of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
They would be asked to be influenced by children.
Turs is the most popular and the most-known act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And then you can get a number of times.
I remember this time when this mother came to her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10 to 10 to 10th, and I came out in my backyard, and I looked at them.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason on the street."
I've been shocked when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that has only been able to do it, and I said, "Mone people, you don't have a fear that you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "Noah, no, no, no, I didn't know that they're going to.
It's also about the road.
But this is the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take their health back."
At another time, I took a garden in this homeless room in the Sama.A.
These are the guys who helped me to put the wheel.
It was cool, and she shared their stories about how it has been influenced and how they were growing their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even though it's changed for a moment.
Green Tans has already been released about 20 degrees.
And we went to our back-tat-tat-through-through-through-through-through-t-through-t-t-t-t-t-t-up-t-t-t-up-t-up-t-t-up-t-t-up-through-through-through-t-through-through-through-through-through-through-
If kids grow solar, children eat.
If they grow green, they eat dopamine.
But if they're not allowed to get a little bit of them, if they're not allowed to recognize how food and body, they're also losing what you're doing, and they're also going to be able to do it.
I see young people who want to work in this thing -- I see color-like children who are at the same direction that they are, and they're in fact, they're all in the way that they're in front of the boat, and they're not going to get nowhere.
The other one I see is a chance where we can train these kids to engage their communities to make a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could take the next George Washington Carace.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do this.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do this.
I want to use a whole neighborhood of urban spaces where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a ship, and we're going to turn it into healthy car.
So, don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-touch, because free is not sustainable.
The epicity of sustainability is that you have to focus through it.
I'm talking to people to get work and children from the streets, and they're learning and the joy and the joy and the honor to experience if you open your own food, and when you open up and reproduce.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want all the environmental forces, the gang, the first-dut-t-t-dut-t-t-d-d-d-up.
We need to zoom through the image of the jungle.
If you're not a pist, you're not a gang.
So you're going to be able to get a "daty, clear?
And let's take the gun to your choice.
If you want to meet me with me, you're not going to call me if you want to sit in the pets and you want to put a meeting where you talk about, or you're talking about some of them.
If you want to meet me, you come through your backyard, so we can actually fly any of the things.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire English English is "ny" "ny" Italian."
Because it sounds like this.
And "Fadian" means "nivious politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a better definition of definition, "Hooce is someone who is a state of a party, or a foundation, or its success, and its success, and its success, and its success of the dominant force of the dominant force.
I don't have any idea about what "cit" is.
I think about words, I think.
But it's very important that words of politics are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to be trying to control language.
1777, for example, according to the British elections, newspapers didn't have the exact word of the argument.
And this was actually back to the courage of a man named the extraordinary name of the Enronio Cash, who was at the study.
They looked at him in London and they put it in London, but he was a serious enough enough, and finally he had a lot of support to get so much support in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the sentence "The Dolus" in many people.
Bretty is about the English word for the pow.
But that's not true. It's going to go back to a foreign response.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you to the United States at the time when it's already invented.
You saw the question about the question of how to say George Washington, the state of the state.
They didn't know it.
How do you call the leaders of a complete nation?
And it's been based on Congress for a long-term basis.
And there were all kinds of pre-creatable devices.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the West Washington, and other, his poor, West Washington, and again, the other freedom of the human freedom of America in America.
Not as a real one.
Some people wanted to call him a king.
They thought it's a place.
They were not a non-nistist, they wanted to choose to choose to give the king for a certain period.
It could work.
But everyone was a bit uncomfortable, because this argument was about three weeks ago.
I read the days of a cartoon that was constantly writing, "I'm just going to do the same issue."
The reason for the end of the time was the most painful that the representation of the house was on the Sistine House.
The most of the public house didn't want Washington to do it. They didn't want to do it.
King, and he may have even give him ideas to the end.
They wanted to give him the most popular, the most popular title that they would give them.
This is called "Agetget."
President. They didn't have invented the title. He just did it. But he just meant that someone who was wearing a series of a series.
So something like the charity of a JA.
He didn't have more size than the "The Recess" or "fat."
Sometimes, the president of a small, and government and government organizations, but it was a really unconious title.
That's why the Den won't get it out.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him a president.
This guy has to be a law of the foreign and the foreign rating.
Who will take it seriously if he has a stupid name called President of America?"
And then after three weeks, the Den had no idea.
Instead, we don't want to use the advice of the title "The Recess", but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they were not necessarily aware of their own and our own institutions, whether it's a state of the state of the state, whether it's the state of the state of the state of the president, not the rest of the state of the state, and the rest of the rest of the state.
You can learn three interesting things.
One, one, and I think that's the best -- until now I couldn't figure out whether the Decess of the President has ever shown.
Obama, Obama, who has only been the title of the title. He's just going to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something that's a rapid -- then you're going to wait to 23 billion years later.
Third, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of the U.S. America today is not so easy to sound more like this, right?
It has a little bit more than 5,000-fatial, and he has the largest economy in the world and a pine drone and all this stuff.
And reality and story has given the title.
And so the Den won't get the end.
They have a more ambitious title.
And the other worry about the state of the unconcy -- now, this is how it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
174.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear waste and so forth.
So at the end of the state, the most of the state of the hospital lost, because nobody feels a bit, if you're told that the president of America is now.
And that's the most important thing that you can take, and I'm going to leave you with this.
Governions are trying to form words to control reality and the reality, but actually change the reality of the words, more than words, as the reality could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a park with about 50 percent of the struggle in the fight of the Sanananan, a 15-year-old, unconventant, a pant, a pantian, a pantian, the Florida.
I'm going to see my black-daughter-daughter-triple-tri-tri-tri-tri and a rocket in the government that I couldn't see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
At the long time, I was a lot of time, but instead of the war of Wama and football and sports and the back-up-towning South America and the non-canialists and the publicism and no publicism and Afghanistan, and I knew that the reconce that I knew before.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm here, a manian, South America, South America, a political and a political artist who has been working in the last nine years in Afghanistan and worked in Afghanistan.
So there are many great things about art, but I want to paint the heart, but I want to make a heart of the heart, and I want to put the personality and re-making and re-through the reality and the reality and also to understand the kind of the ability of the people that we're using the world to live in the world.
I want to spend a day in life -- <unk>B: who is going to spend his terroristism, like "Pat" and the "cat" and the political politicalism and political corruption and political corruption to re-inimate corruption.
And what else could be the war of war, when the genocide and a choice to do with the law of the "Temor." I'm rich. I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to put these al-niiiiii who spend a national.
I want to go to corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rood," where you're going to call a false control on the streets of Indonesia, but instead of selling cars and car-off, and instead of selling money, and they're going to help them to help them to help them to the police in Haiti and the United States.
I want to look at how conflict in Afghanistan has become a part of the "can conflict."
The war and the French moments that they came to him, a new environment for the sports and the design that you can only use, by using a kind of a kind of cure for suicide and suicide bombers, I'm using a local pel, or a few-cat-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in
And I would like to see how a simple pist from Russia, from Kowon's Pellon, to create a dialogue about the development of 187 to develop that today, that today, the development of the dominant conservation of the popular conservation of the Greek, the man of the man, and even even even to protect him a lot of war.
But for all these things, you can come to prison, they can be misundable, unconciable.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self needs to be.
That's my head. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Watson, and I've been working for a model.
For 10 years, it said, "Well, at least 10 years.
I feel that there's a kind of a unconricization in the room, because I wouldn't have this bread.
Fortunately, I'm going to make a little bit of the action.
This is the first time that someone is going to take on the TED campus, so you can be happy to see what I think.
If some women were really busy, when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I'm reading later, I'm going to read Twitter.
I also think I'm pretty lucky, because I can change in very short seconds, and I can change in very short seconds, which you think about me.
And it's not any chance to do it.
These cets are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them at all.
The most difficult part is to move the pel on my head, because you're all going to let me stop, so you're not doing anything long, so it's not as long as it's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
That was a bit uncomfortable.
Well, it wasn't just as a picture.
A image is powerful, but a image is also a concrete.
I've been just changing your own view in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to put my back to my back and with my hand in the hair.
And instead of surgery or the wrongness of the other days I've been able to change, there's a few ways to change our fears and our misinfort -- even though it's a huge and unconricable, and it's a huge impact in our lives.
It's fearless to be honest to me today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a nice woman, and in my industry, we call this a little girl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people always ask me, but to the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I discovered, but that means nothing.
The real reason I became an model is a risk in the genetic and a critical legacy, and perhaps ask you what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we haven't just become beauty as healthy and young and primitive, we're designed by the argument, but also as a big, and the cold, and the white and the white.
This legacy was designed for me. And it's an legacy that I've been sent to me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical in this point, and maybe some kind of a kind of a kind of, "Hooad. JY: Jan. Ran. Fran.
And finally, I'm talking about your model. It's very amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, in 2011, in the year of the University of the University of the University, all the most of the things that were being received, each single single one that was taken, and that was 1477,000 or less likely to know.
The next question that I'm always asked to be told, "Can I become a model if I'm independent?"
And finally, I said, "I don't know it's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get all of that.
You can be president of the United States or the president of the next Internet or a Kan-none-tist, which would be completely unaware, because you're the first one."
If they still say about this great, "No, Watson, I want to become a model," and then I'm going to say, "Who's my boss."
Because I didn't have responsibility for no, and you could be the president of American bird or the business of H<unk>amp;M. or the next one of the Middle East.
And to say, you want to be a model later, and later, you're like to say that you're going to get to win the Jack in the car.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of the model, because unlike heart-tocist, it can only be just present.
If there's a photographer, and the light is exactly like a nice, and the driver says, "Ton, we want to go back to the room, and then we're going to get a picture, and then the moment, and the end of that arm is going back to the back, and you can start back to the back to three and back to three and back, and you can see, and you can see, and you can see, and you can see,
It's about something like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you're driving school and you've done a life and you're not going to say a lot more. If you want to say that President America is going to be a child, but in your life, you're going to be a 15-year-old, and you're going to see it weird.
The next question that I'm often told me is, "Who all the photos are going to be stuck?"
And yes, so every photos are being disrupted, but it's just a little part of what's happening.
This is the first photo I did, and it was also the first time I had a Cosini. I didn't even even even have my time.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I saw just a few months ago, with my grandmother.
This is the day I'm on this song.
My friend had to get to me.
This is me on a pamahyian party, a few days ago, a pist for French elephant.
This is me with the football team and the VA magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not a picture of me.
They're building, and they're building a group of psychos, from Kakas and the Polas and the photographers and the doors and all their students and the bureaucrians and the drones and the drones and the drones and the drones and the course, and they're not.
Okay, next, when people always ask me, "Where do you do things for free?"
Yeah, I have a lot of 20-foot-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day, I went to a store, and I stopped my money. And you gave me the clothes for free.
When I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and it was released by a red light, and of course, we just got to be fired. It took a little, "danah, Mr. Teszler, we could go back.
I have this cost of unconquible things because of my personality and I have people who are looking at their appearance and not because of their personality, not because of their personality.
I live in New York and over the 70,000 soldiers who were beaten and moved in the last year, they were 85 percent black and North Asian and mostly young men.
It's in New York City only 17,000 young, male and Latino, who doesn't tell the question, "Who do I leave?"
But, "How often do I leave? When I'm going to stop?"
And I found this talk for my research, that 1,300 percent of all the years in the United States, and these numbers are not going to be released in the bottom of 38 percent when they're 14 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're likely to say, "If you're a little bit of black hair, you're feeling very happy, you're very happy and you're very excited."
And we're going to give a answer that might be made this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, creative, passionate, passionate, creative people.
Everything is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never say before the camera I never said, "I feel, "I feel sure."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my view every day.
And if you're ever wondering, "Do I have a happier legs and gline hair?"
Then you should meet some micro-catos, because they have the most thin legs and the most cool hair and the most coolest and they are probably the exact way that their most vulnerable women are in the planet.
When I've been willing to get this talk, it's very difficult to get to a very, very, very honest, because I felt very uncomfortable, and I'm really pleased to say, "I've got all the benefits that I've got to get to the wall, and it's also not really hard to feel like this."
It was very difficult to express a legacy of gender and race, if I'm one of the largest rating.
But I'm also happy, and I'm proud to be here, and I think it's really great to do this, before I've been here, or 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, I would probably say I would not tell my career, and I would probably say, I would probably say, "I would never have been paid to be a job, or I would have been surprised.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all have the power of the image in our mind and the misreoodable and misreoodable.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who was already in the unconcy of life: "Mon, the Soliiiii.
But never to be something like a pahiian revolution."
It's almost two years ago, since the Sistine revolution, inspired by the waves of mass and both the informal revolution in the Russian revolution.
I'm going to go with many other other different people, in and outside of the outside of the outside of the catery, to try to start to start a revolution against the dominant regime.
And there was a big revolution.
Boy, alwam and men were in the first group, the end of the law, the freedom of freedom, the freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They've shown a professional courage by being released against the uncongantian dictator.
They've shown a strong sense of mass, from the deep East to the south to the south, to the south.
Finally, after six months of war, almost 50,000 dead, we took our country to break our country and to the end.
But Gahii has a big property, a legacy of the Sistineii, the corruption and the foundation of the process.
Over four decades, Gafusian government and the infrastructure, including the culture and the moral structure of the natural society.
The dominant and the challenges that I realized, as many other women, the civil society, the government of the developed, we asked to be a legitimate and re-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-ex-ex-ex-ex
In the bottom of 200 organizations, while they were now in the case of Gahzz, in Benuz, almost 300 in San Diego.
After 33 years, I came back to Tyia, and with a unique concrete, I started to develop the capacity of human development, human development and leadership.
And with a wonderful group of women, I started to bring peace management, a movement of women, leaders, leaders, who are the goal of the public, to the public, to the political and to our women to the right-being of democracy and peace.
In the clinical elections, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more powerful, a environment that was driven by the selfish politics of lawism and the law of law.
I founded a campaign of peace-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-one choice, to give any law that should be the right to the background and to the political and to the female-in-in-in-t-through-through-through-through-through-through
At the end of the project, our campaign became successful.
Women died 12 percent of the nation's state in the first elections since 12 years.
But very fast, the Islamic elections and the entire revolution, because we're going to put new news from violence.
A morning, we're going to put the back-up-through-through-through-t-t-t-dood-t-t-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-t-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-t-down-t-t-t-t-t-dhrough-up-t-t-t-
On another morning, we've got messages about the terrorist minister and the attack on the message.
And again, another morning, the suicide bombers were sent to the army.
And indeed every day, we're at the law of the law of the law and their common, against the human citizens and their misinimate laws of laws and laws.
Our society, from a general state of state, polarized, and it's expanding by the fundamental principles and the norms, dignity, human justice, social justice, the first thing they found.
Unability, and the pist, the Greek era of the revolution.
I'm not here to inspire you about success history of our re-in-through-up-through-up and the elections.
I'm also here to argue about a nation that we've met the wrong choice and the wrong decisions.
We've done our wrong things.
Because the elections were not building peace or security in Pyia.
Did the re-up-up-up-up-to-through-through-t-t-t-to-t-t-t-t-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-
No, she doesn't.
What is it?
Why is our society going to continue to be illegal and defined by selfish politics and the defination of the rest of men and women?
Maybe women were not the only one who didn't forget, but the female values of compassion, the pist and the act.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a nonprofit dialogue, and it has been used to have the elections that only has the polarization and the drought.
Our society needs the unconcessation of the female's disease more than the standard, the dominant, the dominant, the female.
We need to stop the name of the failure and to ask a day.
We have to start in the name of compassion and the Sabbood.
We need to develop a female-fight-touch that's not only not only to be honest, but also to be honest: Gick, instead of collaboration, instead of a competition, instead of a legal basis.
These are the ideals that has been forced by wary Ry's Law to get peace.
Because the peace has a aln, and in this case, it's about the reconricity and the pelial view.
That's the real thing.
And that's what we need to do in generalize before we do it.
After a lie from the Koran "The Bean" -- peace," "The word of the gay God, "woo, haw."
The word "The Recess", which is known in all the years of the guerrillas, has the same laws of the word "The "The Child" and the Christian and the Jewish Christian, the entire human who all the rich and the people who are all the people who are all the people who are all the people who are all the people who are all the people.
And just like the mother's heart cell phone that's growing in his own, completely so that the reason of the compassion of the existence of the existence.
And so, I said, "My God's all things."
And so, I said, "My God's "dar" has been on my "mat."
Do we all have the people who are being able to get the rest of the world.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "The Recess."
And I was very proud.
In school, we're looking at the story of my -- my I'm the S<unk>amp.C., but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside the world, that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I said, "Well, as the outside of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until to move to a deep time.
And with seven years, I saw a public balance, but I thought my life in North Korea is normal.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer.
But in 1993, my mother took a letter, from the sister.
And then, "If you're here, our five family workers will not be more, because we've been eating two weeks.
We're together in the ground, and our body are so weak that we're going to die."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people in my country were in my country.
At short, I went to the board, and I saw something weird that I can't turn away from my memory.
A ped woman on the ground, and a stumped child in their arm, in his own mother, in his mother.
But nobody helped them, because everyone else had been so busy to participate and to their families.
In the mid-'9s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North America, and many more of them were still, because they eat the grass, and the flies and the sea.
The electricity rate has been more and more likely to be stuck in the night, except the light of China on the other side of the U.S. where we were living.
I always wondered why they had lights, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors in night.
This is the river of the National State -- which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very clear, and it allows North Bronx to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was arrested in the late-term years of war to China.
I just thought I would be separated for my family.
I never thought it's been a million years to work again.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be like North Carolina. But soon I realized that it's not just very difficult, but also very dangerous. Because North Carolina are also very dangerous.
So I lived in a constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would put me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest prison room was true, when I was beaten from the police and sent to the police.
Somebody was told me to be North Carolina, so they tested my Chinese and asked me to ask me several questions.
I had this fear, I thought my heart would be cut.
If anything is unconious, I could be replicated and I'm going to be released.
I thought it would be the end of my life, but I made my emotions to control and answer questions.
After they were already finished with the question, a police said, "The one was a false.
It's not North Carolina.
And they took me. It was a miracle.
Some North Korea, he's going to be able to put in China in the foreignists, but many of them will be released by the Chinese police.
These girls had a great job.
Although they were arrested, they finally moved to massive international pressure.
These North America didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, thousands of North Korea in China, and after North Korea, where they're replicated, and they're being replicated and they're being replicated in public and public.
Although I was lucky, there's a lot of South America.
It's a tragic, that North Korea has to hide their identity and fight hard to fight.
After they learned a new language and work, their world can be considered a moment on the head.
After 10 years of the failure, I decided to go to South Korea, and then I started to start a new life.
I was in South Korea, a bigger challenge when I thought I would have.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
And I also found the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all the Japanese, but in the outside of us, we've been very close to a very few years of the part of the part.
I was through a identity crisis.
Am I Southwest or North-anan?
Where am I come? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could be my home.
Although I realized the connection to the Southwestian life didn't seem easy, I had a plan.
I was really pleased for the exhibition of the university.
Just as I was in my new life, I got a sign call.
The North Bronx Bank started the money I took my family, and when I was a punishment to my family, to a remote place in the country.
They had to be able to run as fast as possible, so I started to plan their flight.
North Korea has to take a incredible route back to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. And unfortunately, I took a plane to China and put me back to the southwest border.
Because my family didn't talk to them, I had to fight them over more than 2,000 miles from China and then then to South Asia.
The bus took a week, and we've been nearly seen a thousand times.
And once the bus was released, a Chinese police police came in.
He took the point of all the time and started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be beaten.
When the Chinese government officials, my family, I decided to be a researcher, and he said that they were a ped, and I was her pre-fatial.
He looked at me, and he said to me, but unfortunately, he thought to me.
We managed to go to the bottomwest, but I had to almost put all my money to the border of the river.
But even after we've been on the border, my family was covered because of illegal border.
After I paid money and paid my family in a month, but shortly after a month, my family was moved to the capital of the forest.
That was one of the largest threats of my life.
I had all done to avoid my family to the freedom, and we were so close to this, but my family was just just taken just just just just just a moment from the South Bronx.
I went to the Department of the Department and the police department, trying to protect my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay money and pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And then, my voice asked me, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is about it.
In the middle-in-daughter English, and I explained to my situation and not to go to a bank, and I paid money for my family and two and two South Korea to get to jail.
I'm pleased to him from a very unconior heart, and I said, "Why do you help me help me do?"
"I don't help you." He said.
"I'm going to open the Northwest people."
I realized that this was an illusion in my life.
The previous stranger who had been inspired for me a new hope that was so helpful to the North America, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the international community as the only self-in-in-in-in-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I moved to South Korea, but the freedom of freedom is just one step.
Many North Korea are separated by their families, and once they get into a new country, they start to start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, the English, the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between people in North America and the outside of the world, because many of us are still living with families, and we send them information and money to change the water, North Korea,
I had a lucky help, so much of my experience in my life, that I want to be able to re-inimate the most ambitious North Bronx, with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot of successful North America in the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just got a hand here today.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
So let me show you my brothers.
Si is two2, and very good at the very good.
He can't talk about it, but it's also influenced by a kind of pleasure that some of the best words could not be.
Si knows what love is.
It's also about a bit of a bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
He's not a pist. He doesn't even look at the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and you're just told you, he never told you a lie.
If he's sitting from our childhood, it's trying to be a little bit, I'm not even aware about it: I remember a little bit about the minds and how we know about the minds and how wonderful.
Samuel is 17. He's very good. He's very good.
He has absolutely absolutely a absolutely unconable memory.
But he also has a re-in-in-in-touch.
He can't remember if he has my chocolate bomce, but he reminds me the report of every year, and he was reminded by my iPod, talking about four of the first thing that he had been the first one that he was in the first-in-in-in-in-in-in-law, and his son.
Don't listen to it.
But many people don't seem to be honest.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit in the social version of normal, they will often start to understand and understand what's wrong.
But what my heart has been committed to my heart and my soul was that even though it was not as a case that it could be known, that it could be just an amazing -- it could be remarkable -- and unusual.
Now, for you who are not as a word "nonism," it's a complex disorder that's a social communication that's influenced with social communication and sometimes learning learning and physical abilities.
It's actually a different part of any individual, which is a very different like Sami.
And all 20 minutes, in a new person, and even though it's a third-growing, the most active environmental development of the world, there is no unknown or cure.
And I can't remember the first time when I'm a psychologist, but I can't remember anything without any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized he was different.
He's very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, he didn't seem to be interested in me.
Siian lived in his own world, with its own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like cars in a series of space, to eat the machine and eat everything that came out of him.
And when he was older, he became different and differences,
But behind the anger and the pony and the never end of the unconricity of the fact that something was a really unconable, a no, and a terrible natural nature, a boy who saw no human activity, who never never had a human mood.
Except, extraordinary.
Now, I can't agree that there were some more creative moments in my family, moments I wish that they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back with the idea of the things that they taught me about individual quality, communication, love, and love, and I understand that these are things that I would not want to act against self-esteem.
Even the beauty of beauty, the differences that we're different, and the fact that we're different, is not that one of us are wrong.
It's just that there's another kind of right.
And if I could just say one thing about a thing to tell you and to Sam, then it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, with the non-zero-sum, the differences that we have -- we have a gift of us, and everyone in all of us, is the ultimate self-esteem of self-being.
The chance of scale, progress and change in the moment that we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
So, Edonon has a conversation with curiosity and curiosity, with this photo on a project called a apple and with a mass of the air of only a millionth.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and you can't see the world with a million or a billion images a second.
So I'm going to show you a new kind of photography that can be the F-M-R-R-R-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-based engineering that's so fast that it can be able to create time from light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that can look at our view of the outside of the screen or not a-ray in our body and ask us, and really ask what we're doing with "LLL".
So if I take a laser, and it's in a decade, and it's a number of a second -- these are two-minute-minute-by-touchs, I'm going to give you a map of neurosonons, and this is almost a millimeter-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-and-and-and-and-and-and-and
So, if you take this project, this animation-by-by-by-by-up-up-by-up-up-up-through it in this bottle, how can these neurosines fly into the bottle?
How light looks like light in the time?
So this whole event -- this whole event.
So, think about this event, it's actually only about a nanoscon -- so it's so hard to take the light to the back, but I'm going to try to get this video to take this extracellular clip to 10 billion billion, so you can see the light in the movement.
No, Coca-Cola has not been funded this research.
So in this movie, it's a lot of, so let me show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, it's going to be in the bottle of a photon that starts to move through and then move through the inside.
A part of the light, on the table, and you see this explosion.
Many of the photosons are finally going to turn the bottle and turn into different directions.
So, as you can see, there's a air that's going to be in the bottle.
And in the same way, the waves on the table, and because of the angle of the angle, you can see that the memory of the end of the bottle are focused on some images.
So if you take a traditional project, and you can take it back to the same process, and we can slow the video back to 10 billion, you know, how long you have to sit here?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in movement.
And how about something that looks like a whole-time-up picture?
You can see how these waves are going on the table, the Tom and the wall on the background.
It's when you put a mountain in a pond.
It looked like nature was like this, like a photo, every one of the things, but of course, our eye shows a different picture.
But if you look at this Tom's hand, you can see that if the light comes out, the light goes through the Tom, you're going to get this light. You're not going to get dark.
Why is this? Because Tom is now and the light goes around and over to a hundred seconds.
So, in the future, if this pel-R-R-R-R-R-R-R.R., it could be possible that you can go into a supermarket, whether you can actually touch a fruit, without touching any fly.
So how did my team do this camera do?
So, as a photographer, if you're doing a photo of a short-term space, you've got a little light, but we're going to get a billion times faster than your initial existence, so you'll get a very good amount of pressure, so you're not doing it in a good way.
So we're going to take this project, we're going to send this project, this satellite-and-and-half million, and we're using this, and we're going to combine very clever, and we're going to combine these nanotic data, and we're going to create these nanos-M-M-M-M-M-M-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-
And we can take all these machines, and we can do very interesting things.
So Rome can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how would it be a new power for a future-based, can see the outside-up,
The idea is that we're going to put something on the door.
It's going to go out and go into the room, and it's going to move back to the door and finally back to the camera, and we could make these more and more carbon-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through
And this is not a science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, our F-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R
On the wall, a pine is hidden, and we're going to put the light on the door.
After our paper in the National Development Foundation, it was published by the nature.com, and they've created this animation.
We're going to get this light project, and they're going to put it on this wall, and we're going to put this neuroson-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-t-through-through-through-t-t-t-t
And because we have a camera that is so fast -- our F-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-T-shone abilities.
It has a very good time to look at the world in the speed.
And by the way, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
By looking at a laser, we can take a functional view that you see -- like you see on the screen -- not really really really really, but if we take many pictures of these images, and we try to start to see the different light, and then we can actually see the light-like object, then we can see the light-like object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering.
We have a lot of things to do before we could put the map of the lab, we could use cars, and recognize what's going on, or we can look at the curve, or we can look at dangerous weapons, and we can actually move through the window of the window, or we can move around the surface of the river, and the river, and the river, and the open-by-like, and the river, and the river, and the river, and the
But because of the pel and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, why the real word is actually a call for scientists, now, today, is now about the new engineering, and that might actually solve the next generation of medical models.
So a few seconds, like Doscon, even a scientist, is a art, a art of the hyper-scapse cave, and I realized that all these nanotos, we can actually use this data, we can actually use a model that we can actually use a new visual image, and we can actually see that structure between the visual structure, and every seconds.
But it's also a bit like this.
If you look at these waves under the glass, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move us into us.
What happens?
It turns out that we've been able to take almost in the light, weird effects and Einstein would have seen this image incredibly amazing.
The approach that happens in the world, in the back of the world, is going to be able to put the relationship between space and time, we can reuse these biases.
So, whether art is about images, or it's a new set of medical health, or new design, since we all have all the data and hope that we hope to understand the data and hope that the re-in-touch, the engineering and the research that we should start to start to start to understand the next satellite map, and to start to start to start to the next-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities to improve our lives.
We don't meet any neighbors on the street, so many of the arguments are not being arrested, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like a little bit of a ded, and the pars and the pars.
The projects came from my questions, how much pay for my neighbors?
How can we stop more things without ourselves to listen to each other?
How can we share our memories on the back-up buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities and our dreams and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is driven by the huge mass that has been trained for hundreds of years, and the pest and the pans and the pans and the pol and the polus, I'm sure, I'm going to have a city that has always always always always always always always always always always always in music.
I think every time someone never never said in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city of most of the most non-cested problems in America.
I'm going to go to the house and think about how I could do it, and I thought it's a little bit that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved.
Her name was Ran, and she was like a mother. Her death suddenly came out and suddenly turned out.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a great passion for my life, and I made me clarity about the things I've been interested in life.
But it's hard to keep this view every day.
It's easy to lose in everyday lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I moved to a page of the house and wrote a huge rock, and I want to get a pist, "Tat, I want to get to get a piece of the book, and I can start to find a piece of life about his public and hope about his public.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but it was already completely completely completely completely completely open, and it grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you who were written by people on the wall.
"Do I want to be fired because I want to be fired."
"Do I want to stand up with the International Recessation."
"Do I want to sing for millions of people."
"Do I use a tree."
"Do I live in the way I want to live "tat"""""
"Do I want to hold it in my poor."
"Do I want to be a person from the polic."
"Do I want to be in my own."
This is a place that was released to a sense of a meaningful place, and the dreams of people, and the dreams of the people, to the laughter, and I would get to the cold and I would get to the hard time.
It's about to know that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and to make a new way.
It's about changing space and thinking about what we're really growing in the most important, as we grow and change.
I've done this last year, and I've got hundreds of people who wanted to build their community with their community, so my colleagues and I've been building a building, and now I've been building a building system in the world, South Africa, Australia, Asia, Asia, and other walls.
We've shown how much power of our public spaces, if we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more and more.
Two of the most valuable things that we have, are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with more sensitive amounts of things, it's more important than ever to look at the right-hand view, and think that life is close and more sensitive.
We're often going to talk about death or just to think about it, but I've found that the interest of death is one of the things that we're all open up most of us.
The idea of death is that we're looking at life.
Our common spaces show us the best of what we think of as individuals and society, and with more opportunities, our hopes, our fears, and stories, to help us help us help us help us help help help help us live better places.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm about a more honest math. It's a special problem for everyone who's involved with, is that we're more interested in a company like a company.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to try to explain this, so I'm going to explain what I do.
Stine is one of the most human activity.
We're just careful by the blind ball and we're going to be able to see the same.
To the ball, a huge amount of action and abilities, and maybe a fundamental solution that could have a genetic element.
Unfortunately, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's been slow, and it's also going to be in my pre-tatatial, and it's also been able to put the back to the time of his time.
And over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, there's 14 million people who suffer to this disease, and they have to live with the unconquible self-tood, the pist, the disease, the other disease that we need to live, and that means that the objective of disease, to discover that disease is too late to discover that disease.
We need to measure the progress of the progress, and finally, the only possibility is to know whether there's a cure if we have a objective effect that we can answer this question.
In trouble, there's no neurologic activity, and other neurologic control, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best one is this 15 minutes of the neurologic neurologic neuros.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and it means outside clinical studies, and it's never going to never be done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a professional tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test?
It wouldn't have a high hospital.
It costs 300 percent to look at the neurologic geography.
So I want to give you a non-zero-zero-term approach that we're trying to do, because we're all in a sense, in least, in a way, virtual, like my pelelel.
So here's a video of the gluting sound.
That's what happens in the healthy state, if someone's being used to look at a mislist, because we have to put all these muscles, because we have to make the sound of the sound, and we all have to make the genes that we all have, for example, CGO2, CG.
And like ball is a huge exercise.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until it's learning.
and by looking at the presence of the memory of the sound of the sound, and as the motor is also affected by Parkinson's disease.
On the lower line, you can see an example of the unconricial memory.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Right, cor, the pist, the cusity.
The language is even a constant and quiet and a paron, and this is an example of a example of this.
These effects can be transparent, sometimes with digital micro-dimensional systems, with new machine, with new design learning, that we can now see now is very advanced, where someone is now in a way that you can actually see, where someone is in a disease between health and the control of the voice.
How can these trials measure? Well, yes, they're both non-nined. The test, and the test is the neurologists.
It's very little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for this.
And both are exactly. It's not the same way that experts are doing.
So you can be replicated.
They're very fast, just 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what it means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in a large scale.
So this amazing goals can be able to do this.
We can reduce unconventical problems for patients.
patients don't have to do a long-term control in the hospital.
We can increase objective data by more sophisticated observation.
We can do low-term investment for clinical studies, and first of the world, we can get a research in the world.
So we now have the opportunity to look at neuroscopic people before it's too late.
Today, we're going to start the first step in this direction, we're going to start using Parkinson's disease.
With A Codel and patients, we want to put a very high number of voices in the world to have enough data to give this goals.
We have a reputation number of four billion people on this planet.
Every one, with no or Parkinson's call a lot of samples to leave, and I'm going to give you joy that we've already reached six percent of our goal in six hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we're going to take 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who are not?
What do you do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to predict whether this person has to be obese or not a case. OK.
Some of them may be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we're going to end up to realize that the actual text of Parkinson's disease.
At the time, you have 25 percent of the negative effects?
It's much better.
My students, I have to put it out, because he's done this fantastic work -- now, so now, that it's also designed to be working on the cell network that allows us to do this project, and we're in 99 percent of the term.
I call this a more effective.
That means that people can buy -- people can call the phone, and they could call people with Parkinson's voice, so that your doctor can actually test your doctor, so that your doctor can test the growth of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. EDI, Bruno, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the Southwest Center.
In the background, the cows of my father and the spring is the Monterey Park.
The Monterey Park is only a bit of a ded in the Southwest. That means that animals can never leave the park every single time.
The wolves, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our forests.
This is one of our cows who died in night. I looked at it in the morning. It was terrible. It was our only pars.
My individual, the state of the Asian, believe that we came together with our animals and the Middle Ages. So we mean, our animals.
I was also studying a child, and I learned to hate lions.
Our terrorist minister. They protect our bodies and our neighbors. They are also trained by this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Monterey.
And I think it's just a lot of lions in Monterey.
In my lungs, a boy between six and nine years, he was also responsible for his father.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions feared.
But then I realized that we didn't really help us, but the lions who help us see the cows better.
But I didn't go on. I'm going to go back.
I had a second idea. I tried to put it with a bird.
I wanted to say that the lions thought I was going to go next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, you can see the bird's rocks and go back to the next time, but they come back and say, the thing is not going to be, it's still here.
And they're going to break our forests and kill our forests.
One night, I stopped the pel. I went to a pow in the hand and then we met it, and then the lions didn't stop the lions.
lions feared light, which is moving.
I had a idea.
And as a little boy, I worked all the day in my room, and I even took the new radio, and I could even take my mother apart every day, and I had almost learned a lot about electronics.
I took a old plane, and I took a motor ride from a motor. It shows whether you want to turn on the right right or right.
And I've got a switch to turn the lights and turn it back.
This is a little pelke from a pelric keyboard.
And then I built everything together.
The solar-powered battery that takes the battery to the power of the car. I call it a propite.
And the re-informance chain.
You can see that the pelps are coming outside, because there are the lions.
And this is what it looks like by the lions when they come.
The lights are moving, and the lions believe that I've been going to go to the back. And I was all the time in the bed.
Thank you.
I've been working with this in home, and since we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was the grandmother.
She had lost many animals in lions, and she asked me if I could put their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I've been using the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since I've been seven houses in the neighborhood with the light and working it well.
My idea is now used to be used in Kenya, even for other predators like fire and butterflies. The lights also use to move elephants from the air.
My invention was to give me a scholarship to a national school in Kenya, Sam, Berkeley, and I'm really excited.
My new school is working with capital and education.
I even took my friends home and we're putting the lights there, where there are no one, and I'm going to show people how to use them.
A year ago, I just had a boy from the war, who was sitting in his father. I saw airplanes and said, "Ean day, I'm going to sit in a room."
And here I'm here.
I took a plane to my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to become a plane and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to kill lions. But through my invention, I can save the cows and the lions, and we can cooperate, on the side, with lions, without arguments.
Peter Olu<unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk>" In my language, this means: Thank you very much.
You know, you know, you know, like, it's a story like your attention.
So you've got this app. Yeah.
You're working on other electrical challenges.
What's the next line on the list?
My next invention, now I work on a electric motor. A-rhythm-cent-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up.
Yeah, I know, electrical pars have been invented, but I want to have my own.
You've been trying to do it, not quite -- -- -- -- yeah, I've tried to do it, but I've been trying to get the trial back, because I got a snumble.
All right. Richard Lynner, you're a little bit special.
We're going to put you in every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to put a camera in your hand, it's photography. But today I want to share with you 15 minutes, and I don't have a single one of them.
There was no kind of public, no kind of a memory, no chance to take a picture. Not even the speed.
To be honest, most of them were released by the previous conflict.
My story begins to be a talk for New York, and my wife, who I did this picture that I call my daughter on her first birthday, and we were on the corner of 45 and five.
And it's just a year later, we've been able to take the same picture.
Well, you can see where it goes from --
When the third birthday came closer to my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why do you want to go to New York and do it? It's a father-in-through-through-through-told, to move the rituals?"
And then we started to ask the reconanial conflict, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like the viewer is a completely stranger that you're doing a completely stranger.
Nobody never said no one, and fortunately, nobody has never been able to put a camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these cities would change our lives.
This journey has been very cold.
This is only a couple of weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened next day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a single moment, or a certain journey.
They are also a possibility for us in October a week, and beyond our time and how we change ourselves from year, not just just just just physical, but in very, particularly in the environment.
Because even though we're always doing the same image, our perspective of time, and while they can continue to move new bits, I can see life with their eyes, how they're using them, and how they see it.
And this very high time that we spend with each other that we're going to expect and expect every year.
Last, while we went back to our homes, we suddenly went back and suddenly looked at how to be a red drone on a tiny child, where they learned a little child in the early age of a child.
And she told me about her feelings that she had been in the exact stage of five-year-old.
She said she was remembered by her heart of the chest when she saw nine years ago,
And now, she looks at high school, because they really want to study in New York.
And I was very surprised, the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you with the idea of creating a active role of memory.
I don't know how it looks like you, but instead of this 15 pictures, I'm not at least a family picture.
I'm always the picture of the picture.
I want to give you any of you today to come into the image and ask you to ask someone, "Do you want to do a picture of us?"
Thank you.
