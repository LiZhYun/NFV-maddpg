When I was 11 years old, I was fired from the sounds of a saint of delight.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show at the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual at the time, because the news was depressing out.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power of Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so I was committing for five years as a boy, and I was advising my older sister who was not allowed to go alone, to a secret school.
Only that's how we could go to school.
Every day, we took another path so that nobody could guess where we went.
We're hidden our books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just going to buy a shop.
We were in a house where we were in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of a nasty, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then again, the class had to be rejected for a week because the Taliban had signed up.
We never were sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to stop us?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we wanted to go to school anyway.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and my daughters were valued.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A remote-hedid from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send my daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
My mother was trained, but she was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retire just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- look here -- the first one in his family who ever received an education.
For him, his children would always get an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He saw it as a much larger risk of sending his kids not to school.
I know, even though I was in the Taliban, I was frustrated sometimes by our lives, by the unconscious fear and the perspective of the perspective.
I had good love to give up, but my father said, "Told, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be displaced in war in your house.
But one thing is always going to keep you. What's inside of it. And even if we're going to pay for your blood to your school, we're going to do that.
So -- do you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have higher degree than the high school degree, and if my family didn't have used so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, when I was a proudly single in the Midwest College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first ones that validate me.
He's not just a professor of college, but also that I was the first woman and I'm the car ride through Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has bigger dreams for me.
And so I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a worldwide campaign for women education.
And so I helped to start, SOLA, the first and possibly the only board for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls's school workers are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to perceive the most ambitious opportunity to perceive them.
And look at her parents and fathers, as my parents at the time, even for me, despite all the deceptions of the day.
Like Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is a father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter was on the home of SOLA in her village, and she was killed by the death on the side of the road, just by a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang, and a voice beat him, if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.
He said, "You know, if you want to, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game for your old-hearted and over-limited imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often deflated in the West: behind most of us who succeed, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that's what she realized is her success.
That's not what our mothers don't mean to be important in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are highly and more convincing to be a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And under the Taliban, there were only a few hundred girls going to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pressing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be different from America.
Americans recognize how uncertainty these changes are.
I'm afraid that change isn't long-term, and it's changing with the United States's territory.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me and the endless possibility, and remember the girls who visit SOLA every day.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, even a living -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as young man.
From 1971, to 1977 -- I look young, I'm not -- -- -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, Algeria, Somalia, projects on the technological collaboration with African countries.
I've worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years, we're Italian good people, and we're making good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples of Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the Islamic Sambica as food was built.
We came to the Italian seed in South Africa, in this elaborate valley, which leads to Sambesi River, and we trained the local population of the aged Asian tomato and the Coini and --
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they began to come.
We were amazed that there was no agricultural agriculture in such a fertile valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't hire anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here!"
"You could even be able to save people from the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderfully in Africa.
We had this gorgeous tomato tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato was ripped and red, about 200 nastrots came out of the river and grappling everything.
We said to the Sambel, "Oh God, the Fil Army!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were Italian, so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French did, and after I saw what they did, I was kind of proudly proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the candle.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we have given the non-human people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a herboman economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been taken.
Just read her book.
Check out of a African, what we've been doing.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionals, and there are only two ways that we deal with people. We parat them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vather."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchical: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisis: I treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called the editor.
I was delighted when I read the book "I'm singing Beautiful" by laughter. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, they leave it alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocololic?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and I invented a system called corporate promotion, where never gets started, never gets motivated, but you're going to be the local passion director of local passion, the servant of local people who have the trauma to become a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put them together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in kitchipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends, we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give a sense of an idea.
If this person doesn't like this person, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important of humanity.
We help them find knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this trap: Why, instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we listen to them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
entrepreneurs never have a part, and they'll never say public what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
Design has this light in there.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to public meetings.
We work on one to do that, to do that, we have to be made a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new profession to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the hospital of the operating room that sits in your house with you, your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the tools to change your passion in a way that transform life.
I've tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was in graduate time, trying to get rid of the disenged flaws where we tell others what to do.
And so I walked through the streets in the first year, and within the first three days, my first customer, and I helped him. He brought fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth, and he would come to the fishermen, and she would say, "You've helped Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped this five fish fishers, and I helped them work together and sell this wonderful tuna in Albany, 60 cents to 60 cents, but to Japan for sushi for 15 dollars.K.K. -- and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them. You help us?"
I had 27 projects in a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do -- I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I hold the mouth and listen to them."
So -- -- -- you know, the government says, "Look, go ahead."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 50,000 companies in the process.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be on loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers in history, died in 96 years ago.
Peter Cash was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter printer said, "Right is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christianchurch, without knowing what the smartest human Christchurch is about to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to one.
You have to provide them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they'll come in.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the most cheated presentation that you've been waiting tomorrow?
"Ayeful, passionate people. You hated that.
I want to tell you that entrepreneurship is the right way to do it.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- infuse fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open-life realm is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, transport and sub-connected them.
The technologies don't exist for that.
Who's going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
The government? Remember it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of New York in 1860 in the year.
In 180, they came together and they made what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York. The conclusion was a binary: The city New York wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows in this pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get their hands, and it's impossible to get the dung of six million horses.
Because they were already lying in crap.
In 180, they see the dirty technology that's feeding lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology had made the race. There were tiny factories in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered discretion.
They don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, committed and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the largest company, all needs to be able to do three things: to sell the market capital, which needs to be great, great, granddiosic, and the financial intelligence needs to be massive.
Do you guess?
We never met a single person who can produce something at the same time and sell for money.
It doesn't exist like that.
This person never was born.
We've done research and we've looked at the 100 idiest companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have, only one: not just one person has been founded.
Now we teach 16-year-old entrepreneurship in Northeast, and we start giving them the first two pages of Richard Bransons Autographography, and the mission of the 16-year-old, to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons's autobiography, as often as he uses the word "through" and often the word "we"
Never "I" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small professional background in cafeteria and bars. They're a dedicated buddy who's going to do what someone has done for this gentleman who's talking about this e-posi. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting corporations in them to help them find the tools and people. We've found that the wonders of local intelligence is that culture and the economy of this community can change, just by the understanding of passion, energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've been learning about being a good thing to be Alice in Wonderland.
The Penn State University asked me -- a Ph.D. to communicate communications -- to promote educational education.
I was afraid.
Right. Fear. Fear from those students with their large brains and their big books and their big books, don't trust me.
But when the conversation came to me, he turned out to me as Alice when she was going down to the pig's pig and he saw a door to a completely new world.
I also felt like I was talking to students, and I was amazed by the idea they had, and I wanted others to find this miracle country.
I think it requires great communication to open up the door.
We really need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy, environment and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go ahead. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-professionist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
I want to show you a couple of approaches, as you can do, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well?
Let's tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only do you think of their grandchildren, but also tell us that their grandchildren, the little structure in our bones, are examined because they're important to understand osteoposis and treat them.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to be able to have any dictionaries.
Now, the dictionary is a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use "talk" and "time" in a while, but why don't you just say "space and time," what's much more enjoyable for us?
And we're going to be able to understand your thoughts, not the same as they're going to be going to drop down to the level.
As Einstein said, "Well, things just as easily as possible -- but not easier."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific area without compromise.
Some things are thought about this: examples, stories and analogies. In this way, you can pull us into your booth.
And when you present your work, let's take the dots away.
Have you ever been wondering why it's called "something."
What happens when someone gets to mind? Another one gets to be weeks, and with those dots, you get your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits too much to the talk-making part of our brain, and it's rapidly challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the pigricity is so stable that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, simplified sentence where the audience can lose the thread once it loses, re-act its images and graphs that also inform our other senses, and therefore creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open up the door and see the miracleland that celebrates science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the "Nerdin" button in my room, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
You can see your science and your textbooks are signing this through the relevance, so the audience says what's important, and multiply the passion you have for your incredible work: And it comes out of the unfinished interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really really embarrassed.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can write a message to a cell phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you get high-petched and famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1994, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that city in the time.
You can see hundreds of thousands of people going to the street and show up.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're wondering that all these people who were coming up and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, my cell phone wants to talk about me and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.88 lines of information.
Plust data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.R. has signed up a policy.
This is a rule of law enforcement.
This is a rule that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service in the entire country has to store a range of prostitution.
Who calls? Who calls an email?
Who is going to send a text message to you?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are all up and they said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to have this reserve protection.
We want to keep self-in-level self-dimensional, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of whom said, "We don't want that."
And here you can see tens of thousands of people marching on the streets of Berlin, saying, "Sunity instead of fear."
And some of them even said that could be the an amas 2.0.
The mask was the Grand Hemlockiican Conhistoric.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Telecom, which was the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, let me give me all the information you've stored over me.
And I once asked her, and she asked her again and she didn't get a right answer. Only a half Bla Bla.
But then I told myself I wanted to have this information, because it's my life that you're doing the plate.
So I decided to put a court test on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going to take the bill back to what they all demanded information to me.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court decided the introduction of the E.U. line was a German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 points of information.
At first I saw it and said, well, it's a huge file. My hand.
But then I realized, after a while, that's my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I'm, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I told myself I wanted to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what the law enforcement is.
So with time and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and forth.
You can take every step that I do, track.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to K<unk>l, and like many calls I'm going to go on.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit scared.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then they call me some friends, and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up, and you call them, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see people communicating together with each other that they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see this all.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction map for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who to call an email, all of this is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said in the beginning, we're going to imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the mask would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the St.C. had known to be the leader, that might never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe it wouldn't happen.
And then, not the case of the Ice Hemisphere.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so much information, how they can get over us, online and rival.
They want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store it for a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
They have to fight for that every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your opponent, just because companies and national states have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information that they stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you've got to fight your self-suffels in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Impute shops, rapid restaurants, Brakops.
So the city map is going to meet and survive changing the name of South Central so that it's for something else, it's changing it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Impended bureaucrats, rapid restaurants, brinkles.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert of South Los Angeles, the home of Drive-thrus and the Drivebys.
The comry is that the Drivetus kill more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in impairable diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than it's in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't stop doing that anymore.
And I wondered, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I'm going to think that rollmill is bought and sell it as a vehicle.
I see a dialogian mask coming in like Starbucks.
And I realized that that's what it's going to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I'd been paying a <unk>18,000 vacation to get an apple that's not labeled with pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the parking lot.
It's 45 feet in diameter.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to be in charge."
And I decided to keep it in the same way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, together, and we started planting my food Air, and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of executive group, together from gardening from all social layers and from all the city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically put me on a plane, and said I have to get rid of my garden, the station was a rapture.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A seductive set of treaties for growing food from a piece of land that you're completely wrong with?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand with it."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind. Steve Lopez made a story about it and talked to the city Council and a member of Green Ground Zero. They signed a petition on Change.org and 900 signatures were successful.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My town even called it, and said they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most real estate in the United States in the community.
They have 67 kilometers in Brack.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato gas plants.
Why the hell should they not find that right?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my body of peace, I tell people they should grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing their own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm happy to be part of this preception reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardenwork is my graffiti. I'm harvesting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's slipping the walls, I'm going to get lawns and park plants.
I use the garden, the earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my own favorite for this stuff.
You would be surprised by what the ground can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden to an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You would be wondering how children are affected by this.
So gardening is the therapeutic and most bold act that you can do, especially in the city.
And you can get strawberry.
I remember this time that her mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and she looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason to go on the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just empowered me to do this. People asked me, "Fin, don't worry about you, you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "Of course, no, I'm afraid they're going to be stupid.
And that's what it's like on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take care of their health."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless garden in the Far L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it affected them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it's just for a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people come in and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow charcoal, children eat charcoal.
When they grow tomato, they eat tomato.
But if they don't get any of them, if they don't get shown, like eating and body influence, they're blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids that are right on the path that they were supposed to be, and that doesn't lead to them.
I see the gardenroom as an opportunity to train these kids to care about their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a ship container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The comet of sustainability is that you have to keep it through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and they're enjoying the joy and honor and honor when you build their own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to be the most ecological rebels, gangs, gangs, gangs.
We need to turn the image of the vel.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You know, you're going to get a dog with a breath, right?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you sit in the web and want to make a meeting where you talk about something that you're going to make.
If you want to meet me, you come in with your knees, in my garden so that we can plant any shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford dictionary is "nnnolly monaster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "throllygoster" means "isless politicians."
Even though a newspaper publisher was in the 19th century, a better definition of saying, "A snollygic is someone who is striving for a foreign party, no matter of course, program, program, and his success, and his success of the pure force of the monumental hypothetical.
I have no idea what the manual is.
Something I think about, in words.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know they need to try to control language.
In 1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers didn't get the exact word of debugging.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was looking at Parliament.
They threw him in the Tower of London, and they gave him a shock, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the sentence "so" as Brass." Many people think.
Brassels are kind of on the English word for the tin.
But that's not true. It's all about a convicted dog's license.
But to show you how words and politics are interrupted, I want to take you to the United States at the moment when it's reached independence.
You could think of the question, like George Washington, the state of state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican nation?
And it was a little bit of debate about this in Congress.
And there were all kinds of concepts that were worthable.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-security George Washington, and again, the propulsion of the human freedom of America's United States of America.
Not that much.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was saved.
They weren't monarchistists, they wanted to choose the king for a particular period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with a little bit of bored, because this debate was three weeks.
I read the journal of a funeral book that was constantly writing, "I've been thinking about the same topic."
The reason for the funeral was the funness, and the boredom was that the representation of the house was against the Senate.
The representatives of the House didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want him to.
King call it, and maybe even gives him ideas to the conclusion.
They wanted to give him the most humbling, most miserable, horrifying title that they would think of.
This title was "The Prince."
President. They didn't invent the title. He had existed before, but he just meant someone to be in a gathering.
It's something like the preference of a jury.
He had no longer had the size of the book as the "talk" or "un water."
Sometimes there were a head of war with small colonial groups and government groups, but it was really a unfinished title.
And so the Senate refused to leave him.
They said, "It's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign the agreement and hit foreign carriers.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of America's United States?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't come.
Instead, you'd think of the word "The Prince" as a matter of being said, but they really wanted to be absolutely clear that they didn't agree with their honest respect for the opinions and civilized nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy where it's the state of the state of the state of the state, not necessarily validated -- the president of the United States, the other, the other, the presidence of the United States,
You can learn three interesting things about it.
First, I think that's best -- until now I can't figure out if the Senate ever confirmed the name of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he just hated the title. He just waits to the Senate.
Secondly, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- -- -- you'll wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is not so humorous, right?
It has to do with something more than 5,000 nucleic swordheads that it has and the largest economy in the world and a flurbation drone and all this stuff.
And reality and story has given the title size.
And that's how the Senate ended.
They have a respectional title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the out of irrational -- well, it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear bombers and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won, and the representative house, because nobody feels shocked when you're told you're now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'll leave you with it.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rebellors at the fight for Mojalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to sit down my black-up black-thrirts against a pair of brown leatherel and a rocket towards the government's head that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been big before the war, but I've been on the war, but I've had a little bit of Pyjama party and a football and a football game and a handling-and-shirts with the racist South America and the bordered political protesters, and I've never been painting with communism and drinking Afghanistan, and I've even known to see what that meant.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, a more, more inspired Afghane, South African-stist from God Ghrades. An atheist and a radical political artist who lived in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So there are lots of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainglows. I want to make art that compelled and stimulate authority and re-write the reality and interpret reality and even using a kind of imaginative human-designed peoples to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in life of a jihad -- a guy who's fighting his jihad against communityists like "Pop Starhead" and using armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihadary funeral when the parliament is willing to go and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Do I choose me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to break this vfiosi that are used as a national hero.
I want to leave the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "reach," where you're going to be a police station, a false control center of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking a bribe from them, providing money to them, and to the police department in Kabul, and to give them the police to them, and they hope that they're 100 of us.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the Intermodest conflict.
The war and the strange views that came with him, they created a new environment for Style and fashion that can only capture a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine the Frarm of South Afghan athletes with a protective coat or a multi-touched, a moderate-tested Western-brain.
And I would like to see what a simple pusher looks like in Kabul, between Kiplell's appellell of 1899 to create a dialogue about the current development organization of development, its origins in the past-dominated graffiti rhetoric of the White Shack, to protect the brown man itself and even to even to even even even even even to colonize it.
But for all of these things, you can come into prison, they can be misunderstood, they can be misrepresented.
But I do, because I have to, because the geography of self requires it.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for some time I work as a model.
For 10 years, it's been said, right?
I feel like this is now built up a very awkward tension in the room, because I shouldn't have that dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit more to change.
This is the first time someone is attracted to the TED stage, so you can appreciate that, I think, that's what I think.
If some women were really slipped out when I came out, you don't have to tell me this, I'll read later on Twitter.
I also think I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in a very short 10-second, what you think of me.
And that's not the chance everyone has to do that.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to carry them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then all of you will wake me off, so no while it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this image.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I've just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should throw my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgeries or the wrong pepper that I took for two days to work, there are very few ways to change our utterness, and our utter word is -- although it's super-picial, and it's essential -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless to me is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How are you going to become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Well, in the last few decades, we have defined beauty not just as healthy and young and symmetrical, where we are programmed biologically, but also as big, pizzy, feminine and bright-braas.
This legacy was created for me. And it's an legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical of this point, and maybe some fashioners are like, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smrow. Liu."
And first, I'm going to comment on your model, which is very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has counted all the modules on the sidewalk, each single one that was being dated, and that of 677-touchs were only 27 or less than four percent of the time.
The next question that always asks me is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja-Soth surgeon, which would be completely wrong, because you would be the first."
If they still say this great incisions, "No, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Am my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for nothing, and you could be the president of the American bird or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meel.
To say that you want to be a model later, that's like saying that you want to win the Jack Prize in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of model fiction, because unlike heart surgeons, it can only be unfolding.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice flier, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo in the run," now the leg first, beautiful, and long, this arm goes back, this arm is on the back, and you move on the foot, and you just move back, and you just look back, and you see your 400-year-old friends, 400-old friends.
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less odd than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and you have a little bit of work and you've done some jobs, you can't tell much more. If you say President President of the United States, but in the room, "Twoty-year-old-old home-to-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day-day
The next question I'm often asked is, "Who is going to release all the photos?"
And yes, pretty much all the photos are stored, but this is just a small part of what happened.
This is the very first photo I made, and this was the very first time I carried a Bikini. I didn't even have my time back then.
I know that's going to be pretty personal right now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me on the day of this session.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days before a magazine for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll see these pictures are not images of me.
They're constructing, and they're constructed by a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and Machup-and-A-and-A-and-and-A-and-and-and-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You know, do you care for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-m-m-m-m-m-m-maf shoes that I can never wear, except just right, but the things I get free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went into a store, and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was going to take a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took a "isor, sir, sir, sirew," and we could go on.
I've got these low-cost things about my appearance, and I don't have people who are looking at their appearance and don't pay a big price for their personality.
I live in New York, and I've been in the 140,000 teenagers who have been shot and filtered over last year, 85 percent black and Latino, and mostly young men.
It's only 177,000 young black and Latino people living in New York, and it's not the question that says, "Am I stopped?"
But, "How often am I stopped? When am I stopped?"
And I found myself in this talk that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is 78 percent when they're 17 years old.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think you'll expect this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and glowing hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backstage, we'll give a answer that might be given to this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring people."
All of this is true, but it's just half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, what I never said before, is, "I feel unconscious."
And I feel unconscious, because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Do I feel happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest crabs, and they're because of their appearance, most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really hard to get a more honest balance, because on the side, I felt really uncomfortable to put me up here and say, "I got all the benefits from a stack that was pounding to my favor," and it doesn't feel very good at the "And that's not always happy."
It was really hard to open up a legacy of harassment for gender and race when I'm one of the greatest useers.
But I'm also happy, and I'm also honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done this here before 10 or 20 years or 30 years ago, and my career has been still faked, because I wouldn't tell you how my first job was, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I've paid college, which is so important.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misordable success and failure.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother that came to life in exil, "Son, Gaddafi Resist.
But never be something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's now nearly two years since the British Revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass mass operations in both of the same things and in the Egyptian revolution.
I joined with many other Libyers, within and outside, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Young, gby women and men stood in the first row, they told the end of the regime, they stopped Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've demonstrated plausible mutators by being put on the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the far west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we were able to free our country and reduce the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a great servant, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the basis of the process.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannical regime has destroyed both infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the lybic society.
The devastation and the challenges, I rented as many other women, to rebuild civil society, to the vetery community, and we asked a regulator and unfinished transition to democracy and national justice.
and at least 200 organizations were founded in the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of exil, I returned to Lybia, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to the issues of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Liby Women, a movement of women, leaders of various lives, whose goal is to be public for sociological empowerment to women, and to be right for our right to the right of rational justice of democracy and peacebuilding.
In the elections, I met in a very difficult environment, a environment that was massively polarized. A environment that was shaped by selfish political politics of dominance and execution.
I led a mission to the peace platform, Liby Women, to get a policy policy, a law that any citizen, no matter what the right, to vote and to vote for and to be a political set of parties, and particularly to a male and female and Russian, and to try to put a ripple and make a tilt on a raster.
At the end, our initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation's national debate in the first state of the year for 52 years.
But, very quickly, the euphority of elections and the entire revolution on the planet -- because every day we started making new news about violence.
We were at the wake of the magazine for the night-to-thathing mosques and Sufi masters.
On another morning, we received news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack.
And then again, another morning, the wounded was signed by the army.
And we're really at the very day, under the tyranny of the milititers and their ongoing successs against human rights and their neglect of rules and laws.
Our society is shaped by a revolutionary mind, polarized, and distant from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- which they originally stopped.
Intuse, persever, rifers became the icon of the Folime of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our funeral and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to tell you that, as a nation, we've made false choices and false decisions.
We've failed our priorities.
Because elections didn't bring peace or security to Lybias.
Did the hard-tist and change between female and female leaders and national acumen?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why is our society still polarized and dominantly dominated by selfish politics and purpose and men and women?
Maybe the women weren't the only ones that miss it, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the dissection.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus configuration than it needed to strengthen the elections that ultimately strengthen the polarization and decoration.
Our society needs to have the qualitative embodiment of the female than she needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of anger and ask a day of revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just blame the next values, but also counterintuitive: Gade instead of Rakes, collaboration instead of competition, rather than execution.
These are the ideals that need to be rested by war,
Because peace has a alchemy, and in this alchemy, it's about the relis of feminine and maskal view.
That's the real thing.
And we need to implement that in general, before we do it in sociological.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam," peace -- "is the word of good God, rawled."
The word "radeem" again, which is well known in all the abrained traditions, has the same Arab root as the word "inach" "inach" and symbolized the maternal feminine, which surrounds the whole humanity, from the manhood and the female, all the peoples, all of all of the peoples, and all of them.
And just like the mother's heart of the embryo growing in him, it's so much of the basic rest of compassion to the whole existence.
And that's why we said, "My Gnade is all about things."
And that's why I was told, "My Gnade has been prelimited in my Groil."
Anyone want to be saved by the Gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "nothing"
And I was very proud.
In school, we were pushing the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Even though I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all of this change.
At seven years, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from the sister of a colleague.
And there she said, "If you're going to get this, our five family members of the world are not going to be there anymore, because we've been eating nothing anymore for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're dying soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about it for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly, I went through the train station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A black woman was lying on the ground, and a broken child in her arm was slightly helpless to his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because everyone was busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-1990s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were killed by victims, and many more and more of them survived because they ate grass, and they ate beetles and tree cortex.
So electricity waste has become more and more and more likely to get me to the night, except for the lights of China on the other side of the bill that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we don't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the amp, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vigorously and allow Northanans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can tell that while I was sent to the devastating years of famine to the distant relatives of China.
I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a quick time.
I never thought it needs 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very hard to live than young girls without family.
I didn't have an idea of what life would be like as a North Korean refugee refugee, but soon I learned that it's not only very difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in silence fear that my true identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police police police department and sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be North Korean, so they tested my Chinese records and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid of this, and I thought my heart would explode.
So if there's anything unnatural, I could be locked and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the test, a official said to the other, "It was a false failure.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are in foreign messages calledyl, but many are caught by Chinese police and rejected.
These girls had great fortune.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released by massive international printing pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, countless northern Koreans are caught in China and they are rejected to North Korea, where they are tortured or imprisoned or publicly.
Although I was lucky enough to escape, many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard for survival.
After they've learned a new language and they've found work, their world can be turned on a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was able to leave myself in South Korea, and I was able to get a bigger challenge than I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea, that I had to start learning my third language.
And I've also experienced the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we're very different from each other, because of 67 years of the part of that.
I was through an identity crisis.
Am I South or North Korean?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the adaptation to the Southern Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show at university.
Just as I was more successful in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities started taking the money I sent my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to be moved to a remote place on the country.
They had to be flying as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made it to the North Pacific border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to hire them to over over 2,000 miles through China and then South Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we almost got caught.
Once a bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official elected my family, I agreed, and told him she was a hermit, and I was her funeral.
He looked at me in a wie, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to go to the moderate border, but I had to almost take all of my money to get the border control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money sentence and paid paid payment, my family was released within a month, but shortly, my family was replicated in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the greatest dislutations of my life.
I had done everything to protect my family to freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested just before the Southern Pacific Embassy.
I went and I went from the Ministry of Defense and the police department, trying to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for money to pay back and pay money.
I lost all of my hope.
And then I asked myself the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised to think that a foreign stranger is taking care of it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without being able to put a bank engine, and I paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger, for me, has a new hope that the North Koreans needed so desperately, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of international community as the hope of the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back in South Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, professional education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family members, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would like to deny Northern Koreans to success, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to have a request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't speak.
Remi knows what love is.
He's not going to divide them in a way that he's not comfortable.
It's not stupid. It doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to remember words that not even I remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has absolutely unfinished memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he's stolen my chocolate pillars, but he remembers the publication of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while the first episode of the teapback on my arm and the Lady King's birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the social version of normal, they're often understood and wrong.
But what motivates my heart and my soul was empowered, that even though that was not popular, it could only mean one, that was extraordinary -- autistic, and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compassionism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that affect social communications, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It's a different thing to do with each individual, and that's why, as close as Sam.
And all over 20 minutes in the world, a new person of autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm faced autism, but I can't remember it without it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He was very much terrified.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and reorganized in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, putting the washing machine and eating everything that came under.
And when he grew older, he became different and the differences became visible.
But behind the anger and the frustard, and the never endless hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been lied.
It's extraordinary.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of things that they've taught me about individuality, communications and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normal is the beauty that give us differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or non-religistic, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each one of us has a gift in it. And in all of us, honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment that we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been filled with awe and curiosity with this photo on a project called a apple, and a nuclear waste period of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography that can be a Femto-m photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create slow-time-lapse images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that can look outside the frame of our view, or without an <unk>-ray image in our body and ask what we mean with the camera.
Now, if I take a laser axle and I turn it into a billionth of a second -- these are several-second-second-second-second-second-up-up-up-mreated samples, which is barely a millimeter-sized, and this photon-patch, this project, it's going to move in light, and it's like, a million times faster than a second project.
So, if you take this project, this photon pack and shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event.
So, think about it, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotabab -- so long as the light takes to go back to this lane -- but I'm going to try to add this video to the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't funded this research.
So, this film happens a lot, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, is going to come in the bottle with a photon stack that starts to move through and then break inside.
And part of the light comes out of the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the steering of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that's coming around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflective of the screen, you can see that the reflection is focused on the end of the bottle after a few images.
Now, if you take a normal project, and you leave it back the same route, and you slow it back to the <unk>10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a year.
This would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about something still-time photography?
You can see again the waves of the table that flush the glass and the wall over the background.
It's like when you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed to me as if nature was painting a photo like this, every single-to-face image, but of course our eye is a folded image.
But if you look at this Tomate again, you'll see that when the light is suspended, it stays more and more, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomate is coming up and the light jumps around in her and back after a few billionth of a second.
So, in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandandy, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if a fruit is a fruit, without touching it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with short air time, you have very little light, but we're more quickly than your shortest nuclear waste, so you're not getting any light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon pack, a multi-million-dimensional, and we're drawing it back and forth with very clever synchronizing data, and we're going to combine this gigabytes of data to make this Femto video that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superhero: to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to put a little bit of light on the door.
It's going to be clamled into the room, and part of it is reflected back to the door, and ultimately back to the camera, and we could use this extra-fold-fold-by-take-up light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall, there's a soup hidden, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the "Nature Communications", it was made by Nature.com, and they made this animation.
We're going to cut this light project, and they're going to pop on this wall, and this photon pack is being poured into all directions, and some of the photons are going to reach our hidden soup that will break the light, and then then the door will reflect a part of the broken light, and then a tiny bit of the photon nerve, and then back to the top of the camera, but it's going to be very interesting.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is to what distance it is.
By making a laser light on a laser, we can record a raw image that -- as they see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but then we take lots of these pictures, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light-through-up memory processes, then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got to do a little bit more about this before we can put this into the lab in practice, we could build cars that avoid collisions and detect what's on the curve, or we can look for dangerous fruit pollutants, by looking at light that's bouncing through the open windows, or we can build end-up-the-the-body right-hand-hand-hand-hand-up-hand-up-hand-up-up-up-
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is a very challenging thing, which is really a roll call for scientists, now, thinking about Femto-mem photographer, because there's actually a new imaging process that might solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edpton, even a scientist, the science has become a art, an ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we collect every single time, not just the science processing process. We can also create a new form of computer photography, and paint, and paint, and the wave, and all of those things are not just about the time that we're looking at, and all of those things that are the wave of time,
But it's also a fun thing to do here.
If you look at these waves under the tube, you can see the waves move away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost blinding in light speed, weird effects, and Einstein would love to see this image incredibly.
The order of events in the world appear in reverse-transc basis, so by using the actual relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter whether it's time for photography to focus around corners or create a new imaging for medicine or new exhibitions, since our invention has made all the data and details on our website, and hope that the "pierakers and the creative community will tell us that we should stop the generation of megels of megels -- to start to start the next galaxy image, to start the next galaxy image of the next galaxy, and to start the next galaxy, and to start the next
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every street on the street so many of the biases don't go through, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and spores and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, like, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for live houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is stalled by the giant oak that had been friends of mine, barbers and shamanic shadows. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time anyone never ever never ever won, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the left parts in America.
I live in the house near and I thought about how I can make it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpectedly.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that are important now in my life.
But it's hard to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose and forget in the daily lives, which is really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I transformed a page of the abandoned house into a giant board and I wrote a wall of the gaps: "Be I die, I want to die, I want to -- " Everyone who's coming back, can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely crowded and it grew.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I'd like to be sued for piracy."
"I'll die, I want to stand on the latest line of the International Recession."
"I'd like to sing for millions of people."
"I'll kill a tree."
"I want to live in traffic."
"I'll kill them once."
"I'd like to be a corbel."
"I'll be mortal." I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to wine and to forgive me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and in a new way.
It's about creating space for the sake and thinking and remembering what's most important in our own growing and changing.
I've done this last year, and I've received hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a construction box, and now I've been building in countries like Kazanazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power our public spaces have when we have the opportunity to stand up and share our voices with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, looking at things with the right view and thinking about life is short and sensitive.
We're often stopped talking about death or just thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation is one of the things that drives us most.
The idea of death reveals us life.
Our common spaces are best to show us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories and stories, people around us can't just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in this sort of mathematical math. I'm a very special problem for anyone who is looking at it with a thorough math, is that we're like a corporate adviser.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try to explain to you what I do today.
dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're thrilled to look at the ruling ballett and beats, as you'll see.
There's an extraordinary amount of evidence and skill, and maybe a fundamental signal that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slow down, that extraordinary ability. It also does it with my slave paper, which was a balletviret at his time.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the unexpected symptom of weaknesses, killings, killings, and other things that cause this disease, and that's why we need to discover objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there is cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
In trouble, there's no biomarkalities for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing to do is to have this 20-minute test with neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinically studies, it never does.
But what if patients could do this in the home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't require a expensive hospital worker.
It costs 300 percent, by the way, to study in the neurological domain.
So I want to suggest to you a unconventional method that we're trying to do this, because we're all, in some sense, virtual nutenos like my Iranian counterparts.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This is what happens in a healthy state, when someone's making a voice sound. We can look at a fake ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs if we create clay, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
And like ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until they're speaking.
And by the sound, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and as the limbs are also affected by Parkinson's muscles.
At the bottom record, you can see an example of irregular vocal resonance.
We always see the same symptoms.
True, weakness, perseverance.
The language is even becoming more aged and nourged, and this is an example of theymptom.
This impacts can be minimally, sometimes with digital microphones and precision software, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now tell where someone is in a spub of disease and health, just because of the mood.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test is in neurologists.
It's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And they're both accurate. They're not exactly the right tests that experts are being done.
So they can be done in their own homes.
They're very fast, they're at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it at large scales.
And this amazing goals can be done with this.
We can reduce logistics problems for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through the current observation.
We can do low-cost mass-costized investment for clinical trials, and first of all the population is really possible.
We have the opportunity now to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's health institute.
With Aculab and patient'sLike, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data, to make sure of this goals.
We have reputation numbers that are accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone, with no Parkinson's disease, can call cheap to leave a few-cent-second images. I'll give you joy that we've reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of them, say 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to tell if this person has Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you may not be able to get it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, in various circumstances, which is interesting. These circumstances are important, because we are to sign them up to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the same time, their 86 percent accuracy has?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to blame him because he's done this fantastic work -- has shown now that it works on the mobile network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a improvement.
That means people can -- people can call the phone and do the test. People could call their voice to Parkinson's disease so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and the behind the kitchen is Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the South, and that means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, they follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning and found them dead. It was horrible. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we came together with our animals and the openland of heaven, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I've been learning to hate lions since I was a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our enemies. They're also brought to this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park is just as few lions.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years of his father's cows. That's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Beus fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions help see the cows better.
But I didn't get on. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried it with a bird's.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to be next to the cow.
But lions are very clever animals.
You come, you see the bird's records, you go back, and the next time, but they come, and they come, and they're not moving, you know, this is still there.
And they take a chance to reach and kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the Stall. I walked around with a tapel in the hand, and this time the lions didn't rain.
lions are afraid of light moving.
I had an idea.
I was working on my room for a little boy, long day in my room, and once again, I took the new radio apart from my mother, and the day she almost took me. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took a old car battery and a motor control from a motorcycle. It shows if you want to turn right or left. It's bright.
And I made a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little snack from a broken pockets lamp.
And then I built it all together.
The solar panel is encoded the battery, the battery is providing electricity to the right-source plant. I call it a transformer.
And the right-controlling is a blunt.
You can see that the pads are out there, because they come from there.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are bright, and the lions believe I'm walking around the bar, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our homes, and since we've been having no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see the lion in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really working well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, also for other predators like hysen or leopard seals, and the lights are also used to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged and helping with donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights in there where there's no other, and I'll show people how to use them.
I was just a year ago by the savanna, who was crippling his father's cows. I saw planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one day!"
And here I am.
I was allowed to be a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to ignore lions. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions in common, we can live on side, on the side of the lion, without arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. A electrode fence?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented long ago, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, not yes, I've tried it before, but I've left the trial, because I got a blow.
All right, Richard Turder is hard. You're a little special.
We're going to hire you on each step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and not one of them I did.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no chance to shoot a picture again. Not even the lighting was thought of.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story starts when I was a lecture in New York, and my wife made this image, where I hold my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57th- and five-year-old.
And just a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see what's going on,
When my daughter daughter's third birthday came up, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and make a father-daughter's grandgeise check to keep the ritual going on?"
At the time, we started asking tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal gesture is when you're going to be a completely stranger to get his camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately nobody is still in charge of our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a moment of a moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a way for us to keep the time in October and how we change our time and how we're year after year and how we're not just physically, but in particular.
Because while we keep making the same image, our perspective of time, as they're reaching new miles of miles, I can see life with their eyes as they deal with everything, and how they look.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something we appreciate and expect every year.
Lastly, while one of our travels, we walked for a walk, and suddenly she remained as a result, she shows up on a red barp of a dollboard that she had learned as a little kid in the earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old at the exact exact place.
She said she remembered her heart of his chest when she first saw the store nine years ago.
And now she looks in New York schools because she really wants to study in New York.
And I was very clear to myself, the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like in you, but besides these 15 pictures, I'm not at all a family photo.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come into the image and tell someone, "Would you like to ask a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 25.59, 57.5/33.5/21.0/13.5 (BP=0.942, ration=0.943)
