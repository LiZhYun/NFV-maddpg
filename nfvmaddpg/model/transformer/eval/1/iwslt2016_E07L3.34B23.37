When I was 11 years old, I was taken out of the sounds of the sounds of the day.
My father heard on his little, gray radio show at the BBC.
He looked very happy about what was unusual at the time, because he was often known to the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'm never going to forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban was running the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and he was banned girls to go to school.
So I was committing for five years as a boy and I was preparing my older sister who couldn't be able to stay alone, to a secret school.
Just so we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way so nobody could guess where we went.
We were in our hidden books in the lunch store so it looked like we were just going to buy a supermarket.
We were in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of disgusting, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then again, the lesson had to be rejected for a week because the Taliban had been attacked.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to be rejected?
Did you know where we live?
We were afraid, but we were still trying to go to school.
I had been very lucky to grow up in a family where education was more important than daughters and daughters were identified.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanist, who was struggling to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
But my mother was born.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to turn our house into a school school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- this was the first in his family who ever received a school.
And it was always obvious that his children would be given a training, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked at it as a much bigger risk to send his children not to school.
I still know that I was frustrated in the Taliban during the years, and I was so frustrated by our lives, by the unconscious and the interpressedness of the process.
I had good fun to give. But my dad said, "You know, listen me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be transported from your house.
But one of you will always be: what's inside there, and even if we're going to pay with your blood for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give me a little more?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have a higher degree of college, and when my family had not been so much for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudly uninventor of the Middlebury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he was complaining to send his daughters to school, one of the first that I was passionate about.
He's not just about my graduate degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who's driving him through the car with Kabul.
My family believes.
I have big dreams, but my family has more common dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for women's education.
So I helped to start building ROLA, the first and maybe only a bank of girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still risk-tri.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to be able to perceive the great ambition of all of them.
And see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as my parents at the time, despite me, despite all the time and against the events.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter was his daughter, and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they are the death of a bomb on the street for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone was ringing, and he was sending him a voice, if he was sent to school, she would try to do it again.
He said, "I'm going to kill me now, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter on the game because of your old and unrained ideas."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that is often going to be approved in the West: the back of most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that's not the success.
That's not what our mothers don't mean is that our mothers are not going to be a critical role in our success.
They're often the ones that are more compelling and more compelling for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely responsible.
At the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are fighting the school bank.
Afghanistan seems to be seen by America, so different.
Americans recognize how uncertainty these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long-term, and they are changing with the U.S. population.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are helping them, they're more willing to be able to do, I see a very promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unconcient possibility, and I remember every day, the girls who go to the MuLA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, as a living -- my life -- was defined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1973, I look young, but not -- -- -- I have -- in Zambia, Kenya, I've been working with the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia in the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NROO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought, 21 years, we thought that we are Italian good people, and we were able to be able to get good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which I was inspired by the first book "Ripples of Zambrus," was one of the things we wanted to show Italian-sex people of Sambias, how to be transported food.
We came to the 19th seed in South Africa, in this slug Tal, which led to the Sambesi River, and we taught the local population of the civilian, Italian tomato and the ...
Of course, the local had absolutely no interest, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they began to come up.
We were amazed that there was no agricultural agriculture in such a so-called plant.
But instead of asking why they don't build anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."
"You know, if you're time, you're going to save the people of Sambias before you're going to be a man."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this super-la tomato. In Italy, they were so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Sambelers, "Look how simple agriculture is."
When the tomato rose and red, over the night, about 200 pilpards came from the river and graves everything.
We said to the Sambel, "Oh God, the nilrond!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, which were the English world, which were doing, after I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proud to our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the nilles.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we have in the wrong with the non-conventional African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid Aid Aida of Dambisa Moyo, she's a Norwegian economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been done.
Just check your book.
Think about an African leader, which we've been doing.
We are Western people, Victorianists, colonialists, missionals, and there are only two ways that we deal with people. We're geystalists, or we're patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
Romanticic: I'm a different culture, as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisis: I'm a different culture, as if they were my grandfathers.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bider," the boss.
I was beaten up when I read the book "Sallame of Doodame" by the mantra. He said, especially in the economic development, if people don't want help, they're still in peace.
This is the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, Mr. Teszler, who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and asked, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocololese?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react only to people, and I invented a system called a company that never is being replicated, never gets motivated, but you're going to be encouraged to be the local passion of the local love, the local people who have a better dream.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We make a look at the cafes. We make ourselves in the knells.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to close to friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea.
If this person doesn't like what you want to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own grown is the most important of humanity.
We're helping them find knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
For many years, I had this case: Why instead of getting into a community and saying, what do they do to them, why don't we hear them? But not in community training.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
Business never has been part of it, and they're never going to say public science, which they want to do with their money, what they want to do for opportunities.
Recess has this light.
The smartest people of the community don't know because they never seem to be public meetings.
We're working to do one to do that, a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job needs to be created.
This is the company's Hospital, the hospital of the business that sits with you in your house with your kitchen table and in the cafes, helps you find the tools to make your passion in a way that you want to make life.
I've tried this in a bietity, West Australia.
I was preparing for time, and I tried to get rid of the unencessive flaws, where we're going to say other things that they should do,
And so I went through the streets for the first year, and I had my first three days in my first client. He helped him. He was a fish in a garage. He helped him sell Maori. I helped him to get a restaurant in a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen said, "You've helped Maori?"
I helped these five fishermen, together, and I didn't sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany, 60 cents for 60 cents, but to Japan for Sushi for 15 dollars. And then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them."
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Let's do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We helped 50,000 companies in the process.
There's a new generation of companies who are still tracking loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers of history died in 96 years ago.
Peter Cochrane was a professor professor before he was involved with companies. Peter printer said, is design is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Recess is the death penalty spirit.
So you build Christian's leg without knowing what the smartest human being of Christch is doing with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to one.
You have to provide them disclosion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they will be more likely to be.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What you've been paying for most of the time to do tomorrow?
<unk>Audience, passionate people. They've been willing to be brave.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the popular fossil fuels, the manufacturing, all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
The automation machine is not sustainable.
The open-off-off-off-off is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, to cure, to plant, and to replace them with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who's going to reinvent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Excuse us.
The government? Remember it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a semicistian magazine a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of New York in the year in 1860s.
In 180, they came together and they made them compatible with what would happen in the city in 100 years, and the conclusion was a non-profit: the city of New York won't exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grew up in this pace, they needed six million horses to get paid to people, and it would be impossible to be done with the dung of six million horses.
Because they were already in the crap.
1860s, they see the dirty technology that's been broadcasted by New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, in the United States, there were 1001 automotive companies -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology was done, there were tiny little factories in the back of the country.
Dearly, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered to be discourse.
They don't come and they're talking to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, committed, passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of the things that you have to do is to sell three things: that must be super-etic product that needs to be super-end-fist and financial planning.
Do you think?
We never met a single person who can do something at the same time, sell to money.
It doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 exrinal companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wicehouse, Edison, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been meant to be, just one: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16-year-old entrepreneurship in Northeast, and we start to give them the lessons to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransonsons's Eobiography. The job is to be able to support the first two of the first two sides of Richard Bransons of Richard Brons's archive, how often he uses the word "tichal" and often the word "s"
Never "I" and 32 times a second.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the progerers who have a small professional background in cafes and Barss and their very supportive buddy who are going to do what someone's done for this gentleman who's talking about this Eagogue. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to be a person for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are helping companies to help them find the tools and people. We found that the miracles of the local people can be changed by the socialities of the local population and the economy of that community can only be understood by the passion, the passion of their imagination and their imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be Alice's miracles.
The Penn State University asked me -- a Ph.D. for communications -- to address engineers in communication.
I was afraid --
Really afraid. Fear from those students with their large brains and their large books and their large books and their large ones, I don't know what they are.
But when the conversations developed, he turned me like Alice, when she was driving down to the liver, and he looked at a door to a very new world.
I was just thinking of the students, and I was amazed by the idea that they had had, and I wanted to find that other miracles were born.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need to really need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy and health and health, and if we don't know anything about it, it's not going to happen. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-profits, to look at these conversations.
But these amazing conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
So I want to show you a couple of ways of how you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy with is sexy and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer is, well, and what?
So let's tell you why your scientific field is so relevant for us.
Don't just tell us that their grandchildren are looking at their grandchildren, but also tells us that their pores, the little structure in our bones, because it's important to understand the supernovae and treat them.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to be able to call any kind of non-tritical.
In the words, there's a obstacle to understanding your mind.
And I'm sure you could use "t" and you can use time and time, but why don't you just say "t" space and time," what is much more compelling for us?
And we're trying to make sense of understanding, not the same as your level is to turn down.
As Einstein said, "Well, things like this just as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us about your scientific territory without dealing with tradeoffs.
Some things are about this: examples, stories and analogies, so you can take us into your cat.
And if you're looking at your work, you'll take the points away.
Have you ever asked why it means "through" in the end?
What happens if someone gets to mind? Another one is just going to be weeks, and with those dots, first of all, your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits very much on the discussion of the brain's work-based approach, and it's rapidly challenged.
This example of Gene Bonbove's a lot more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the body is so stable that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, simple sentence that the audience can lose once it's lost, and it can be able to counter-trop, and it also makes our other senses more deeply, and it creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that can help us to open up the door and see the miracles of the world that lead science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been taught to help me to make the "The Grand Grand Grand Buy in my tight contact, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
And if you look at your science and your preconceional points, you share this by the popularity, the audience says what's important, and you multiply the passion that you've had for your incredible work, and it's made out of the more simplable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really interested in it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can see a crime in the human race of humanity in Syria.
You can start a message with a phone. You can start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a song, you can get it up in sound cloud, famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm 1996, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
And you can see how thousands of thousands of people were going to change the road and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're thinking that all these people who were being born and they were asking changes, they had a phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phones up, keep them up!
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
These are many. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 3588 points of information.
We have raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Recess has been a policy line.
This is a rule of law enforcement protection.
This is the rule that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service of Europe has to store a range of users in the entire country.
Who calls? Who's going to send a email?
Who is sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are up and said, "We don't want to do that."
They said, we don't want to trade this criminal protection.
We want to be a self-of-the-the-dimensional, and we don't want to be able to store the phone companies and Internet services all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to do that."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people on the streets of Berlin looked at us, and they said, "Fumanity instead of fear."
And some of them said that could be a Stye 2.0.
The Stye was the head-touch police in the east-downland.
And I also wonder if this really works.
Can all store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the German telephony, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, I'm going to give all the information you've ever been wearing over me.
And I asked her once, and she said, "I couldn't get a right answer. Just a more blue flower.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that you're doing with the fluorescence.
So I decided to put a court process against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German Telegraph said no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going to take a look at what they all demanded to me.
Because in the meantime, the federal court response decided that the introduction of E.U. was at the German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown break with a CD.
And on the CD, this was it.
35.830 points on information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My hand.
But then I realized after a while, that's my life.
These are six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I'm asleep at night, which I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to go to this information with the public.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what the criminal protection means.
So with time and open data City, I did this.
This is an visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see how I'm driving from Frankfurt, with the train to K oil, and how many calls I'm going to go.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then I'm going to call a couple of friends and they're calling each other.
And after a while, you call up, and you call them, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where times they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who is the leader of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a design plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design, as you can monitor a society, because you know who speaks to who is sending a email, all of you can do is that if you have access to that information.
And this information is saved for least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I first said, we're going to imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in 1989, were in their pocket.
And the Stasi had known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stye had known, who were the leader, it might never happen.
The case of the Berlin Walls may not have been done.
And then not the case of the ironical curtain.
Because today's government agencies and companies want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and unrolled.
They want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store all the time long.
But self-esteem and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-esteem today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your prophet, just because companies and government countries have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to the information they've been stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight to your self-level policy in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Comular stores, rapid-speed restaurants, Brack.
So the city plan is to make it happen, and we thought, the name of South Central, so that he's going to be different for something else, but it changed in South Los Angeles, if that changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Comular stores, rapid-speed restaurants, refrigerators.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food world in South Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivehrin and Driveys.
The comic is that the Drivehrus is more people kill more people than the Driveysys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in criminal illness.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than about Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even get it.
And I wondered how you would feel if you had no access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I'm going to be bought by a carshake, and I'm sold as a tool.
I see a dialogue centers going straight like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what I've got to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no fun at 45 minutes of day-daughter to get an apple that's not equipped with pesticides.
So I planted a food keyboard before my house.
It's a piece of land that we call parkwater plant.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to be engaged.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I need to be in the position."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came up and my group, the L.A. Green Grings, and we started to plant my food heat and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of professional group, together from all the social layers of all the city and all the city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else is worth it.
The city came to me, and he basically set me a contract, and he said I have to get rid of my garden, which was going to be a contract to a popular configuration.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
A popular requirement for growing food resources on a piece of land that you're totally not?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A Times got wind from this. Steve Lopezet made a story about it, and talked to the city department and a member of Green Ground Zero. They did a petition on the top.org, and we were successful with 900 columns.
We were holding the victory in the hands.
My citymate even called, and he said they support it and love what we do.
So what do they not do?
L.A. has the most open spaces in the United States in the community.
They have 67 kilometers of real-touch spaces.
These are 20 Central Park.
This is enough land to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell should they not find it OK?
Through the plant of a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my Holage, I'm telling people that they should grow their own food.
Their own food is how to print their own money.
Look, I have an legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew up my sons there.
And I'm more excited to be part of this unconcived reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
Look, I'm an artist.
Working is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm going to make my lawns and park.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my most disoriented for this stuff.
You'd be surprised by what the Earth can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was going to be a tool for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You'd be wondering how children are influenced by it.
So the most respected thing is the therapeutic and the most bold act that you can do, especially in the city.
And you get straws.
I remember this time that mother and her daughter came out, it was about 10:30 in the night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and I looked at her.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason for the road."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that was just empowered to do it. People said, "You're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Fum devil, no, I don't know that they're stupid.
It's also on the street.
Now, that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time I want to take it back to your health."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless garden in Dort L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to put the plaster.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced, and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it's only a moment.
Green Grips have been planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people who were getting together and they were all volunteers.
When children grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomato, they eat tomato.
But if they're not offered anything, if they're not shown how food they're influenced and body, they're blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color-eyed children who are just right now at the path that they were looking for, and they're not going to get there.
I see the kind of a chance that we can train these children to care for their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do it.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a ship drone tag and turn it into healthy cafes.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-touch because free is not sustainable.
The comricity of sustainability is that you have to keep it through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and children from the streets, and they enjoy the joy and the honor of being engaged and the honor when you build their own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want to be the most environmental rebowers, the gangiest, the gangiest,
We have to turn the picture of the ganglight.
If you're not a hiring, you're not a gang.
You're going to be a "luggle", you know?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't tell me if you're sitting in a well-dat-tervice chairs and you want to do a meeting where you talk about it, you know?
If you want to meet me, you come to your skirts, in my backyard so that we can plant any more flaw.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nnnnnnolly monaster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "Tnollyhrold" means "the unmaritable politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher was a better definition: "A Buolly Folly Fold poster is somebody who is a pre-reemed act of party, or a program, and his success is caused by the most direct force of the aristocracy.
I have no idea what the "preative" is.
Something like, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers were not allowed to be the exact word of debuting.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Bracby, who was looking at the parliament.
They threw it into the Tower of London, and they made it, but he was courageous enough, he was willing to be willing to re-for-discovered, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first tag for the sentence "weass" very strong as Brass." Many people believe.
Rumping is on the English word for the pch.
But that's not true. It's going to be back to a prisoner's license of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are unrelated, I want to take you to the United States at the time when they've just reached independence.
You saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
What do you call the leader a legal nation?
And it was a long-term argument about Congress.
And there were all sorts of mispressed suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Govern Washington, and other, his highness of George Washington, and again, the propination of the human liberty of the United States of America.
Not such a coherent one.
Some people wanted to call him king.
They thought it was saved.
They were not monocististic, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the days of a editor who was writing all the time, "I'm still thinking about the same issue."
The reason for the time is to be bored, and the fun was that the representation of the House was against the Senate.
The representative house of the House didn't want Washington to be stupid. They didn't want to.
King calls it, and maybe he could even get to ideas.
They wanted to give him the most shocking, very, very ugly title that they would be.
This is the title of "The Talk."
President. They didn't invent the title. He had been before. But he just meant that somebody was being a collection of a collection.
Something like the preception of a jury.
He had no longer the size as the term "tss" or "tssal water."
Sometimes, president had small colonial workers and government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
So the Senate refused to get it.
They said, "It's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy has to sign up and make foreign drivers.
If he's going to take him seriously, if he's got a stupid little title like President of America's United States?
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't have been there.
Instead, you were not supposed to use the word "The Book of Mind" in the way, but they were absolutely aware that they were not supposed to be honest about their honest respect and effective nations, whether it's in the Republic of Monarchy, where it's the state of the state of the state of the state, which is not necessarily responsible for the leader, and the president of the president,
You can learn three interesting things.
One, I think that's best -- until now I can't find out if the Senate has ever been claimed as a result of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just been the title. He's just waiting for the fact that the Senate is active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something that's temporary -- -- -- then you're still going to get 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today's State of America is not always so aggressive, right?
This has been more than 5,000 nucleic fever that he has and the biggest economy in the world and a hugton drone and all that stuff.
And reality and story has given the title.
And so the Senate won at the end.
They have a very respected title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the misfort of sin -- now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147, 147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear wastes and so forth.
So at the end of the Senate, the exatary House won, because nobody feels shocked when one said that you're now the president of America's United States.
And that's the most important thing that you can take, and I'm going to leave you with.
Governments are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually change the reality more often than words could never change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a Laster with about 50 Fort Reasure to combat Sharalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian priest from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm looking at my black column of black-triplebed with a pair of brown leatherers and a rocket on the other direction of government that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I had been big, but next to Pyjama party and football party and football meetings with racist countries and parties and non-religistic documents that no one had lived with communism and Afghanistan and worked for peace and re-discovering and re-diction.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, a more, more enlightened Afghan, South nations of God Nnnnnhe, and a sociistic artist who lived in Afghanistan for the last nine years, and created.
So, in Afghanistan, there's a lot of amazing things about what you could do, but I personally don't like to paint rain-through a lot of rainshakes. I want to make art that makes the personality feel confused and reporters and re-interroduce reality and even the way that we can actually help people to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- a terrorist who's fighting the jihad against communists like "Popif" and armed religious failure and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihad of jihad when the parliament was to be a lawyer and do a choice campaign with the Pantheon: "You know, I do jihad and I'm rich."
And I'm trying to use this campaign to let this mafiosiosi who spend a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with the reason, with a project called "Rearse," where you're going to be a police, a false control center of Kabul, but instead of taking money for them, to pay money, to be able to get the police in Kabul, to help them that they hope that they believe 100 percent of Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become a role of the Interformical conflict.
The war and the strange view that they came with, they created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture using a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I put the local mothers from local Afghan mothers with a local-town or multiple-towned fashion.
And I would like to see how a simple fliss of Kabul looks like Kiplell Pellellell's app, who looks like 18th to create dialogue about this, that today's development-s development-sustainable leadership is in the previous international tourist of the day-discovering of the man's Elephant's "The Elephant of the man to protect the brown man and even a little more civil society.
But for all these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood, misdiagnosed.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self is supposed to be.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, just so.
I feel that now, in this room, there's a very unconditional tension, because I didn't have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I'm still going to have a little bit of a change.
This is the first time someone is going to be on the TED stage, so you can be happy to see that I think.
If some women were really embarrassed when I came out, you don't need me to say that, I'm reading later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think.
It's not everybody's ever got a chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweats over my head, because you're all going to wake me out, so you don't do anything long as he's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, I'm not sure it was so embarrassing as this picture.
A visual is powerful, but a picture is also flat.
I've just changed my mind in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never been a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should be able to put my back oil and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrong brine that I was trying to make for two days ago, there are very few ways to change our fears, and our word is unregular -- although it's a big impact on our lives.
Being uncomfortable is to be honest today.
And I stand on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a nice white white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
Now I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery, and a critical legacy, and maybe ask yourself what is the legacy.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and aggressive and symmetrical, in the way that we are biologically programmed, but also as big, feminine, hot-tood.
This legacy was created for me. And it's an legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashioners might be "Halt. Naomi. Joan Smink. Who's."
And first I'm talking about your model fiction. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.A. student in 2007, at NYU, all the methods were counted on the lengths, every single one that was being trained, and that by 6770, only 27 or less than four percent, I don't know.
The next question I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And I first say, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can be president of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja-law who was totally wrong, because you're the first."
If they still say, "No, Cameron, I want to be a model." I say, "Sear my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for nothing, and you could be the head manager of American bird bird cancer or the business teacher from H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meel.
And I want to say that later, you want to be a model, that's like, you're going to say, you want to win the Jack Treater in the serger.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to demonstrate you 10 years of a model of fiction, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be progressed.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice flier, and the customer says, "Camer, we want to run a photo." Now, the leg is first, long, long, this arm is going back to the back, the head is moving on the side of the foot, and you're just moving back in three feet, and you just see it, and you can see 400 times of his family.
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school, and you've done a few jobs, and you can't say much more, unfortunately, if you want to be president of the United States, but you're in your lifetime, "10 years of underwear," you're looking strange.
The next question I'm often asked is, "Who is all the photos going to be rejected?"
And yes, so almost all the photos are being replicated, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
This is what I just saw a few months ago with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this film.
My friend had to be ashamed.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a Shait of French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V-A magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not images of me.
They're constructs, and they're a group of professionals, from Hacentylologists and remixers and photographers and their peers and their peers and their execution. They're not.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "Well, you know, you're not doing anything for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-degree gloves that I can never wear, except the things I can get free are things I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and I had been in love for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was leaving a red light, and of course, we were just stopped. It took a "Fearw", Mr. Teszler." And we were able to go on.
I have this affordable stuff because of my appearance, not because of my personality, and there are people who are looking at their appearance and don't pay a high price for their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and filtered over the last year were 85 percent of black and Latino, and most young men.
It's only 177,000 young black and Latino, who doesn't mean the question: "Am I going to leave?"
But, "How often am I going to leave? When I'm going to be rejected?"
And I found out that I was talking about this talk that 53 percent of all the 13 years of all the women in the United States don't like their body, and that number is 78 percent when they became 17 percent.
The last question I'm asking is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little bit thin and glowing hair, you feel very happy and amazing."
And we're going to give a answer that might be given to this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never said before the camera, what I never said before the camera is, "I feel confident."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my sight every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Do I have happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some of the modules, because they have the most thin legs, and the most beautiful hair and the most coolest badest badest ones, and they're probably because of their appearance, most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to get a more honest balance, because at the other hand, I felt very uncomfortable to go here and say, "I got all the benefits from a couple of people who were attracted to my thro." And it doesn't feel very good to me, and it's not very happy to say, "And that's not always happy."
It was very difficult to really open up a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the biggest uses of the most.
But I'm also happy, and I feel honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've done here before 10 or 20 years old, and my career has been more reluctant, because I probably wouldn't tell my first job, or I wouldn't tell you how I was not going to tell, I might not tell you how I was paid to be a college.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our distorted and misfort.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother who had come to life in exilation, "Son, the Gaddafi Resist."
But never to be something like a Gafafafafi revolution."
It's now nearly two years since the Croonian revolution has been arrested by the waves of mass-driformance events and the Egyptian revolution.
I was so connected to many other indigenousists, within and outside of Abhny to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannian regime.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, Gayby women and men were in the first row, the end of the regime, held the end of the regime, held the courage, dignity and social justice in the air.
They've demonstrated an investigative mutant by providing against the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east of the west, until the South.
After a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and reduce the tyranny.
But Gafafi has left a big act of honor, an legacy of tyranny, corruption and the basis of the process.
Over four decades, Gaddafis tyrannian regime has destroyed both the infrastructure, including the culture and the moral structure of the gyian society.
The liberation and the challenges, I realized how many other women were going to rebuild civil society from Australia, and we asked to have a nonprofit transition to democracy and national justice.
And at least 200 organizations were founded during the moment of Gaddafis in Bengghahen, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of exil, I came back to Lybia, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops in the challenges of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Elyese Women, a movement of women, leaders, who are in various ways, who are at the end of socializing women's leadership, and to keep our right for the right-to-being of democracy and peace.
In the election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more intense polarized, a environment that was defined by the selfish political politics of dominance and determination.
I led a initiative of peace platform to reach women with a legal policy policy policy, no one of the citizens who should be willing to vote with the right, and to pay for political parties, and to address women between male-scale and rapid-speed, and to make a balance.
At the end, our initiative was taken out, and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation's national justice campaign since the first elections for 52 years.
But very quickly, the euphority of elections and the whole revolution, because every day we were thinking about new news about violence.
We were looking for a morning to the recovery of ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
On another morning, we got the message about the murder of American ambassador and the attack.
And then again, a day, the suicide bombed were signed by the army.
And indeed, every day, we were at the leadership of the Treasure and their ongoing findings against the human prisoner's prisoners and their neglect of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind, polarized and moved from the ideals and principles of "thood" to dignity, social justice," which they first had.
Inturance, mastery and trigble were turned to the icon of the era of revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our success story and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to admit that we were as a nation that had been discussing false choices and wrong choices.
We did a false job.
Because the elections were not allowed peace or safety in Lyia.
Did the appropriate and the change between female and female leaders and national acumen?
No, it doesn't.
What's it?
Why will our society continue to be polarized and dominant by selfish politics and determination and both men and women?
Maybe women were not the only one who was missing, but the female values of compassion, the Gouble and the un-inception.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a consensus for it as it needed to be the elections that ultimately has been empowered by the polarization and decoration.
Our society needs to have the qualification of the female's female as it takes more to the numerical, quantification of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of anger and demand a day of the revenge.
We have to start by the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We have to develop a female discourse that doesn't just blame the next values, but also it's also a little bit more like Rame instead of collaboration, rather than rejecting.
These are the ideals that one of the war needs to be fought by war, to achieve peace.
Because the peace has a alchemia and in this alchemia is about the reaching of the feminist and the butterfly view.
That's the real thing.
And that's what we need to do in general science before we do it sociologically.
After a lie from the Koran "Salamam" -- " Peace" is the word of the most good god, cou."
The word "rall" again, which is known in all the de-war traditions, has the same Arab root as the word "inach" and symbolified the matal feminine of the whole humanity, the man's female and the female and the Jewish of all the peoples and all of the peoples are in.
And just like the mother's heart attack, which grows in, completely around the rest of the compassion of the rest of the whole existence.
And so I said, "My Gnade is all about things."
And so I said, "My Gnade was in front of my homal."
Let's all be the kind of a nenade of the Gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were looking at the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a change of everything.
At seven years, I first saw a public approach, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had to have never been suffering from suffering.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a mentor from a colleague of mine.
And he said, "If you're going to be here, our five family members are not going to be more in the world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're soon dying."
I was so shocked.
I first heard about this that people were suffering in my country.
Shortly, I went through the station, and I saw something terrible that I can't delete more from my memory.
A grin woman was on the ground, and a rifed child in her arm would be helplessly helpless in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because all of them were so busy to care for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were forced to sacrifice victims, and many more of them survived because they ate grass, the beetle and the tree.
Lights have been more likely to be more likely to be so much more smooth to me at night, except the lights of China on the other side of the world that we lived.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and her neighbors in night.
This is the river of the Ivory, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very, very, very easily, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
But many die.
Sometimes I was able to drive bodies in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the devastating years of famine to China.
I just thought I was separated by my family for a short time.
I never thought it needed 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be as North Carolina's refugee, but soon I learned that it's not only very difficult, but because North Koreans are actually seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in silence that my real identity could fly in, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police police police, and I was sent to the police department.
Somebody was accused of being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese fears and asked me a lot of questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
If anything unnatural might seem, I could be locked up and be rejected.
I thought that was the end of my life, but I managed to control my feelings and answer the questions.
After they were done with the questions, a lawyer said to the other, "It was a false failure.
She's not a North Korean teacher."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China in foreign messages likeyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police and they are released.
These girls were great luck.
Although they were caught, they were finally released by massive international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, thousands of North Koreans are caught in China and they are released to North Korea, where they were replicated, they're being rebuilt, they're being rebuilt,
Although I was lucky, many other North Koreans don't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
After they've learned a new language and they've found work, their world can be put on a moment.
And after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was leaving myself in South Korea, a bigger challenge, as I thought I had been.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And I also noticed the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we're very different from a very narrow, because of 67 years of the part of that.
I was walking through a identity crisis.
Am I South or North Korean?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the synchronal of the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording test in university.
Just as I became more successful in my new life, I got an innocent call.
The North Bronx authorities started to take the money I sent to my family, and as punishment became a victim to be moved to a remote place in the country.
They had to be flying as quickly as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go back to a remarkable route on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself on the northwest border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to hire them more than 2,000 miles through China, and then Southeast Asia.
The bus was taken a week, and we were almost caught.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police police police officer came in.
He took the idea of all, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese officer promised my family, I decided to be determined, and he said that they were a pier, and I was her for her album.
He looked at me, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to make it until the dotical border, but I had to almost go to the money to try to get the limits of Lijuana.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was replicated because illegal border is overfitting.
After I paid money and paid paid paid for a bribe, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family was replicated, in the capital of Lijuana.
This was one of the biggest dislutations of my life.
I had done everything to help my family to help, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went out and forth between the foreign authorities and the police department, trying to help my family be free, but I had no enough money to pay for money or money.
I lost all of my hope.
And then I asked myself, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is concerned.
In broken English, and I explained my situation, and without a police, he went to a bank engine, and paid money for my family and two South Koreans to get them from jail.
And I was very upset with him from my very personal heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Bronx African people."
And I realized that this was an symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger has been symbolized for me for a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
After all, after our long journey, my family were and I was again in South Korea, but the freedom of being able to get a step.
Many North Koreans are separated by their families, and once they come into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, the English learning, the profession training and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world because many of us still remain in contact with families, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from each other.
I had so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would have been trying to resist the hopeful North Koreans with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Koreans around the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to have a request today.
Please tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big, very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he's communicating joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not be.
Remi knows what love is.
He's connecting them in a sense of unconcribed, and he's not going to reveal them.
He's not stupid. He doesn't look at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and they just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's not even trying to remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the minds and how wonderful the unknown people are.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has an absolutely unconditional memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate sandwich, but he remembers the previous year of all the album from my iPod, talking about four years when he was the first result of the teublet, he was in my arm, and he was a lady's birthday.
Don't you listen to amazing?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit in social version of normal, they often get over and wrong.
But what my heart encouraged me and my soul was that although that was the case, although they were not equally popular, that it could only mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "the Physicalism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that affect social communication and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a different thing that's happening in every individual, which is Remi, as a Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes, in a new person, will be noticed autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing-growing interventions in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm a neuroscientist, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and he actually didn't seem very interested in being in me.
Remi lived and replicated in his own world with its own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like driving cars in a row, and eating everything that came under.
And when he grew older, he became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the blind and the never-recessive hyperactivity was something that was quite unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any externality, a human who never had been shocked.
Amazing.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of things that they taught me about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I wouldn't want to compete against normality.
Normal is the beauty that we give us differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody of us has a gift in honesty. And in all of us, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying at the moment that we try to be like someone else else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edon was really excited about curiosity and curiosity, which is a project that's been put on a project of a apple, and with an outbreak of a millionth of war.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
So I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femtototo-D photography, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can make time slow-sap-up images of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look at the outside of our view, or without a <unk>-ray in our bodies and really ask what we do with "Ramera."
Now, if I take a laser clip, and I take it into a billionth-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-one-th-one-one-one-one-by-one-one-one-one-one-through-up -- these are several-touching-touchs-touchs-touchs-and-touching, which is a little bit more than a thousand-a-half
So, if you take this project, this photon piece of paper, and you take it into this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event -- -- this whole event.
So, think about it, the whole event actually takes less than a nanotip -- so long as it takes to go back this route -- but I'm trying to get the quick thing to do the 10 billion so that you can see the light in the movement.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happened, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, is going to be in the bottle with a photon leaf pack, which starts to move through, and then then the one in the inside.
Part of the light is coming out on the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the elevator and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that's going to be around the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out of the table, and because of the reflection of the top of the screen, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some of the images.
Now, if you take a typical project and you can take it back the same route, and you can slow it back to the second 10 billion years, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
A week? No, a year.
That would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what does it look like with a little still-time photographer?
You can see again, the waves of the table, the Toms and the wall over the background.
It's like when you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the natural nature would paint this picture, each of them, a Femto-R-screen image, of course, our eye looks a set of images.
But if you look at this Tom's Day, you'll notice that when the light is clicking on Tom's orbit, they're not going to keep the dark.
Why is that? Because Tom is a turner, and the light is moving around in her way and then out of a decade of seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto-Rouse is built in your Camerahandandandy, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if you're a fruit, without touching it.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you do a photo with a short-term period of war, you have very little light, but we're going to get a billion times faster than your very short-term expansion, so you'll get the light.
So what we do is we send this project, this is a satellite piece of photon, a million times, and then we start to combine it together with very clever synchronization, and we combine these gigabytes of data to make this Femto video that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data data, and we can do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superhero: to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to make a little light on the door.
It's going to be replicated in the room, a part of it will be reflected back to the door, and eventually we could use these more extra times of light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femtoto-R-R-R.
Behind the wall, a paste is hidden, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the "Nritical Public Office", it was released by Nature.com, and they've created this animation.
We're going to be able to cut this light project, and they're going to be put on this wall, and this photon piece is being replicated in all directions, and some of the photons will be able to reach our hidden soup that will be able to break the light again, and then then then the door will reflect a part of the light, and then a tiny bit of the photon nerve is going to be closer to the very small moment.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femtoto camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time-effective solution, and it can look at the world at the speed.
And so of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So by making a laser, we can take a raw image that -- how do you see on the screen -- not really make sense -- but if we take many of these pictures, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light-through-up, then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering process.
We've been able to do something else before we could actually do this in the lab in practice, we could build cars that are able to avoid the data, or we can look at dangerous distances by treating the brain by looking at the open window, or we can build the endowoto that looks around the body of the body in the light of Doscopy.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, so that's really a re-up call for scientists, now, thinking about Femto-D photography, because a new model of medical engineering can actually solve the next generation of medical engineering problems.
So, like Doconon, a scientist, even a scientist, is a art of the ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we're using is not only the science process. We can also create a new form of engineering, a new sculpture of photography, and we can only look at the shadow of the shadow, and we can't even look at that layer of time.
But it also happens to be funny.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should be moving us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we almost cut into light speed, strange effects, and Einstein would have been very much like to see this image.
The order of events in the world is going to appear in a rapid order, so by using the actual relationship between space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter how to focus around photography or create a new visualization for medicine or new interfaces since our invention has been able to open up all the data and the details on our website, hoping that the creators and the creative community is to tell us that we should stop our research and our new generation, to start to start to start the second-up sequence of the camera,
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many of the discussions don't be passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors, and use things like a little bit of a little, a trader and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much money is my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without each other?
How can we share our memories on the limits of the buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being disrupted by the giant light that has been served for hundreds of years of loved ones, hiring and carnors of shadow. I trust a city where music is always.
I think every time anyone never has, in New Orleans, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the most of the lost neighborhoods in America.
I'm going to live in this house and I've been thinking about how I can make it feel more comfortable, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came out and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it made me clear about the things that are now important to me in life.
But it's hard to keep this view every day.
It's easy to lose your daily lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the home to a giant board, and I wrote a huge crossboard with a cross-up of the gaps: "I want to die, I want to -- everyone who can come back and take a piece of chalk, thinking about his life and their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect at the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and she grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be accused of piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to stand on a broad-time line on the International Recess."
"I'm going to kill, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to live in trouble."
"I'm going to die, I'm going to keep it in my arms."
"I'm going to die, I want to be somebody's cavicary."
"I'm going to die, I want to be myself."
This was a place that was neglected to a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people were bringing me to laugh, and I was so upset with the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's a new and un-connected way.
It's about creating space for a place and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change us.
I did this last year, and I had hundreds of stories of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I now built a buildingbox in countries like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to speak to our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, looking at things with the right-hand view, and thinking that life is short and sensitive.
We're often going to be rejected by talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I realized that the effort is one of the things that most strengthfully strengthfully strengthed us.
And the idea of death is that we have a life that we have.
Our common places show us the best thing that we are important as individuals and citizens, and with more opportunities, of our hopes, of stories, of stories, can't only help us make better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved with a more experimental math. A special problem for everyone who is busy with the traditional math is that we are like a business worker.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain today, what I do.
So dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're excited about the vision of the master ballet and the loans that you're going to see.
On ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skills, and maybe a basic response that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly slow this extraordinary ability. It also does it with my foreign Janri Abval At the time that he was a ballburb.
For years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
However, there are 6.3 million people who are suffering in this disease, and they have to be more sensitive to the inevitable symptoms like weaknesses, proxy, more people who are causing this disease. So that's why we need to be able to discover the rational cure to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only possibility is to know if there's a cure, if we have an objective measure that we can answer that question.
In trouble, there's no biomarkality and other movements of Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20minute test with neurosologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means, outside clinically studies, it's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a pre-in-in-in-dour tour hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't require a labor hospital.
It costs 300 percent to study in the neurological field.
So I want to suggest you a preconventional method that we're trying to achieve, because we're all, in some sense, virtual, like my violin address.
Here's a video of the vibrant vocal muscles.
This is what happens in a healthy state, if someone's been creating a speech machine. We can look at it as a legitimate balletic dancer, because we have to coordinate all these gestures, if we make the sound, and we have all the genes for it. Fox2, for example.
And how ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to be learning it until it's learning.
And by the loud, we can determine the position of the vibrant muscles, and the way the limb is also affected by Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom of the record, you can see an example of irregular vocal feedback.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
It's a little bit of shame, a pugity.
The language is even more frant and more frer and more, and that's an example of a curator.
Now, this effects can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and analysis, combined with new machine learning, which is now advanced, we can now tell where someone is in a gas between health and health, because of the mood of the deer.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-revasive. The test with neurologists.
It's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And they're exactly accurate. They're not going to be done by experts.
So you can be done by yourself.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely cheap, you can also use it in a large scale.
So this amazing goals can be done right now.
We can reduce logistics difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to do a routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through conventional observation.
We can do cheap mass-term intervention for clinical trials, and first of all the population is possible.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's disease headquarters.
With Aalabab and patient'sLikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough seed data for the promise of this.
We have a GPS number that is accessible to a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, with no Parkinson's disease, can buy cheap to leave a few of the pictures for a few cents, and I'm sure we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we say 10,000 people, you can tell who is healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to be able to claim if this person is suffering in Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you may not be able to get it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under various circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we are so important to test these things, to identify what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the time, you have 86 percent accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to make him feel so amazing work -- now, it's shown that it's worked on the mobile network, which is what we're doing at 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a more improvement.
That means that people can call -- people can call the phone and they could do the test. People could call Parkinson's disease, they could let their voice go so that their doctor can actually check the progress of the disease.
That's what it is.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and that's behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a little bit more accurate in the South, which means that wildlife can rely on the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buock.
My tribe, the tribe of the Maai, believes that we were coming together with our animals and the Ottatland of heaven, so that's why our animals are so much.
As a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our warrior is called Morans. They protect our tribe and our enemies. They're also trained because of this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions who were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so many lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years for the cows of his father. That's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Men are afraid of fire.
But then I realized that this wasn't really going to help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't get on. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to find it with a bird.
I wanted to think that the lions thought I was going to be next to the cow.
But lions are very clever animals.
You can see the bird's records and they go back. But the next time they come, they come up and they say, the thing is not moving, it's still here.
And they take away and they kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the bar. I went through a bail in the hand around him, and that time, the lions didn't get to the police.
Men are afraid of light that moves.
I had an idea.
And I worked all the time I was working all day in my room, and once again, I took my mother's new radio apart, and the day she was almost around me, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took a old car battery and a right-touched driver from a motorcycle. It shows if you want to turn right or left.
And I made a switch to turn the lights up and turn it out.
This is a little snop from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar fiber is actually providing the battery that's producing electricity to the right-source. I call it a transiteator.
And the policy is a little bit more subtle.
You can see that the snails are coming out of the outside, because from where the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are shining, and the lions believe that I'm going to go to the dall, and I was all the time in bed.
Thank you.
I've been installing this in our home, and since we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I built the lights. You can see the lion colony in the background.
Since then, I spent seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they really work well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including other predators like hysen or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention was still given me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helping money services and education.
I even got my friends home, and we put the lights together, where there's no one, and I'm going to show the people how to use it.
A year ago, I was just a boy from the savanna who was crying out of his father's cows, and I looked at airplanes, and I said, "I'm going to sit in a dinner day."
And I'm here.
I was allowed to be inspired by a plane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to be a lion. But by my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions in common with it, we can live on the side of the lion, without arguments.
Ash<unk><unk><unk><unk>nn. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your own.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, now, I work on a electric fence. A electrodezame?
Yes, I know, electric color are invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've been trying to do it, not quite -- yes, I've tried to do it before, but I've been given a little bit of time, because I got a blow.
It's hard. Richard Turder, you're special.
We're going to be able to hire you every step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
For me, I've been old enough to keep a camera in your hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and I'm not just doing it.
There was no kind of a director, no styleists, no chance to shoot a picture, not even be considered the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tours.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife was doing this picture that I gave my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57 and five.
And so a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture.
Well, you can see where this is going.
When my daughter came closer to my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina to New York, and do it a father-law to keep the ritual?"
And then we started to ask the training tours, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, how universal the gesture is when you're a completely stranger, you know, it's enough to be able to get his camera.
Nobody has ever said no, and fortunately, nobody is still sitting with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened day, so that a five-year-old, that it can understand.
These pictures are much more than just a pre-exited moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us in October one week, to keep the time and how we're going to change our time and how we're year after year, not just physically physically physically, but in particular.
Because whenever we do the same image, our perspective changes for time, as they reach new distances, I can see life with their eyes, how they deal with everything, and how they look.
And this very intense time that we spend with each other is something we expect and expect every year.
So earlier, while one of our travels, we went for a walk, and suddenly she suddenly stayed as a result, she shows a red brand on a little bit of a toy store that she had learned as a little child at the earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she had been more than five-year-old at that point.
She said that she was reminded how her heart was coming out of the chest when she saw nine years ago the store for the first time.
And now she looks at high school schools because she's really trying to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like in you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not nearly a family photograph.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
I want to be able to be able to get into the image of you today, and don't you say somebody to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 23.37, 54.5/30.6/18.4/11.2 (BP=0.966, ration=0.966)
