When I was 11 years old, I was in a morning of the sounds of the sounds of the strange joy.
My father heard it on his little, gray radio show to the BBC.
He looked very happy about what was pretty unusual at the time, because it was mostly known by the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obvious that my father was very happy.
"Now, you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
A real school.
The Taliban was putting the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and I was not paying girls to go to school.
And so I was stalled for five years when a boy and I was a young sister who didn't have been able to get away alone to a secret school.
It's just how we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to guess that nobody could guess where we went to.
We're going to put our books in the supermarket so that it looked like we'd just go to the store.
We were in a house where we were in a small room, over 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was kind of cold, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were expecting our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And over again, the class of the class had to be stopped for a week because the Taliban had stopped.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to be asked?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we had to go to school.
I had a great fortune in a family where education was important and separated by daughters.
My grandfather was far more likely to do.
A foreign from a remote province of Afghan war, and he was going to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and became shocked by his father.
But my mother was a teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, they went to the retirement, just to turn our house into school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- this is the first thing in his family who ever received a education.
It was always clear that his children would have a education, even though the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked like a much bigger risk of getting their kids not to school.
I know that, in the years, I've been frustrated with the Taliban, with our lives, from the unconscious fear and the perspective of ignorance.
I had a good fun to give up, but my father said, "Please listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be transported in war in your house.
But one thing is going to always keep you, which is what's in there. And even if we're going to pay with our blood care of your school, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give you a little bit of time?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age, women have a higher age of the high school, and when my family didn't have been used so much for education, I would have also been a woman.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proud, a very honest parent of the Middle Satan College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather was swallowed by his family because he was given his daughters to school, one of the first things that I've been concerned about.
It's not just with my school school, but it's also that I was the first woman, and it's the car that's going to drive it through Kabul.
My family is in my family.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
And so I'm a global master for 1010, a global campaign for women.
And so I've helped, I've been able to start to start to build MALA, and maybe the first business of girls in Afghanistan, a country where school school school is still still not risky.
It's wonderful to see how students of my school are looking at the most powerful repertoire of them.
And see how their parents and fathers are going to a stand for them, while my parents were in my parents, and despite all the missing events.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is a father of mine.
A month ago, his daughter was his daughter, and he was on the home of MALA in her village, and they're the death of a bomb on the road just to be able to get a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone was sent to him, and a voice sent him back to school, she would try to try it again.
And he said, "You know, if you want to do it, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter's games because of your old and disbelief."
What I've been able to do with Afghanistan is that I've often realized something that's often going to be clear in the West: behind most of us, the success of the daughter, the value of his daughter, and that's the most aware that their success is also success.
It's not to say that our mothers don't play a critical role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are highly sensitive and compelling for a very promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men.
At the Taliban, only a hundred thousand girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, there are three million girls on school.
Afghanistan appears to look like in America, like this.
Americans recognize how predictable changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not from the long, and it's changing with the U.S. population.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them for them, then I see a very promising future change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and unconpling possibilities, and remember every day I remember the girl who went to the MALA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, also, as a life, my life -- was made by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977, I see young, but it's not -- I have in Sambia, Kenya, the Sierra Leone, the Sierra Leone, Colombia and Somalia, with the technical projects of African countries.
I've been working for a Italian U.O. and every single project we made on the legs, failed.
I was very helpful.
I thought, 21 years ago, we were good people in Italy and good work in Africa.
Instead, we were killing everything we did.
Our first project, which my first book was inspired by Zamvood, was one of the people we wanted to show in Italy in Italy, how to be transported to food.
We came to the Italian seed in South Africa, in this clear valley, which is where Sam-A-K-K-K. We trained the local population of the Russian and the Great Asian and the Coini and ...
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we were making them affordable for work, and sometimes they started to come on.
We were amazed that in a so dense agricultural agriculture, we had no agriculture.
But instead of asking why they don't build, we just said, "God, we're here."
"Tear time in time to save people from the Sambans of the Constitution."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this super-foline tomato. In Italy, they were so big in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how just agriculture is."
When the tomato gas is red and red, about 200 Niles came out of the river and flaw everything.
We said to the Samban, "Oh God, the Nil!"
And they said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
"Why don't you tell us this?" "You've never asked us."
I just thought we were so great in Italy, but I saw what Americans did, what the French did, what I saw when I saw what was the French, what I saw, I was pretty proudly in our project.
We were at least putting the nilp.
You should see the stupid -- you should see the mismonest thing that we don't have the existing African people.
They should read the book "Iad Aid" from dayst, Mahoyo, it's a post-profit economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent of the continent of 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been made.
You just listen to your book.
You know, you're reading from a African, which we've been trained.
We are Western people, the Colombianists, the mission, and there are only two species of how we deal with people. We're using them or we're a conservationist.
Both words are from the Latin root "wad," which means "Fad."
But they have two different meanings.
Romanticist: I'm going to make myself another culture as they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm going to make myself another culture as they were my gay.
That's why white people in Africa are called "La Di, the boss.
I was shocked when I read the book "Sally" "Seary" in the world. He said, especially in the economic development, if people don't want to, they're going to be in your own.
This is the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
Today, Mr. Mr. Mr. Teszler, who's been in this conference, a mountain on the ground and asked, "Can you imagine a city that's not a non-ololololic drought?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and we decided to have a system called a company called company where no one will never be motivated, but you will be forced to the local, the local, the local community of the local people who have a better person.
What you do -- you're holding your mouth.
You've never reached a community with ideas, you're going to put together with a local.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafeteria. We meet ourselves in K-mow.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to close by friend and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give someone a idea.
If this person doesn't like this person, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
For many years, I had this case of failure: Why instead of getting into a community and telling people what they're doing, why don't we hear them? But not in community.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community collecters.
A lot of entrepreneurs have never been part of it, and they're never going to say what they want to do with their money, what they're going to see for.
Reaching this light.
The most popular people of the community don't know because they never seem to be public meetings.
We're working on one to do that, to make a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has been created.
This is the house of the company of the company, the house of the house that you're sitting in your kitchen and in the cafeteria, helps you to find your passion in a way to change your life.
I've been doing this in the field of the West, and I've tried to do it.
I was a researcher at the time, and I tried to get out of the brugy, where we say other things they should do to escape.
And so I went through the first year and I had the streets in the first three days of my customers. I helped him a fish-dirline fish in a garage. I helped to sell him to a restaurant in a restaurant, and then the fishermen and the fishermen said, "You helped us help us.
I helped these five fish together, and I didn't have to work together with this wonderful tuna in Albany in 60 cents, but to Japan for 15 dollars. And then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them help us.
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do -- I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I'm listening to the mouth and listen to them."
So -- so the government says, "Do you just do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've been able to build 40,000 companies in the process.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be on loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best business worker in history, died under 33 years ago.
Peter printer was a professor of philosophy before he was involved with companies. Why printer said, actually, design is unregulated with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Recess is the death of the entrepreneurs of the genius.
So you build Christy's sugy, without knowing what the most ugly human being is with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get a look.
You have to provide them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to be more sensitive.
In a community of 10,000 people, we'll get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people, intelligence and passion?
What's the presentation that you've already been hearing about most of the time today?
"Hear, passionate people. They've got this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right path.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the most effective fossil fuels, the manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The cure machine machine engine is not sustainable.
The open-up of the public is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, plant and transport them with them.
The technologies don't exist for that.
Who is going to reinvent this technology for the green revolution? Do you forget?
The government? Do you forget?
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a sort of unconventical magazine for a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of New York in the last year of 180,
In 180, they came together and they made them out of what would happen in the city of New York. The conclusion was a prime: the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows in this speed, they needed six million horses to get people to get it impossible, and it would be impossible to be done with six million horses.
Because they went in crap.
180, they see the dirty technology that lives of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there was 1001 companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology was made the race. There were tiny factories in the back of the jungle.
Doody, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be sent to the discourse.
They're not going to come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolutely, generous and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the largest company, they have to be able to do three things: that's got to sell super-tech product that needs to be the market market market market and the financial literature.
Do you know?
We never met a single person that can produce something at the same time, and sell it to the money.
That's not something that doesn't exist.
This person never been born.
We've done research, and we've been looking at the 100 most popular companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wattle, Ed II, the new companies, Google, the Gates, the U.K.
There's just one thing that all successful companies in the world have been, just one person, has been founded by one person.
Now we teach 12-year-old women in Northeast, and we start to give them the first two sides of Richard Brans's Covological Monica. The job is to be the first 12-year-old side of Richard Dolas, and it's also used to be used by the word "s" as often as much as the word "s."
Never before "I'm" and 32 times a time."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody did a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the CEO of the CEO, a small leader in the cafeteria and Bars, your courageous friends who are going to do what someone in this gentleman has done for this man who talks about this, who is something like, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Do I think I'm like to have somebody?"
We're using communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support companies in the way that they can help them to help people and people, and we found that the miracles of local citizens are able to change the culture of this community and the economy, just by changing the passion of the passion of the life and the human imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned about how it should be, Alice's dilemma.
The Penn State University asked me -- a Ph.D. to communication -- to address engineers in communication.
I was afraid.
Right. Fear. For those students with their big brains and their big books and their big words, I don't know.
But when the conversation came up, it was how Alice did it go down to the cure of a pigricane, and a door to a new world.
I was just like, when I was talking to the students, I was amazed by the thought they had, and I wanted to find that other miracles of this war.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need to need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy and health, and if we don't know about it, and it's not going to be progress. I think it's not going to be in our responsibility as scientists, it's not about these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers didn't invite us to their miracles in their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit on us.
I want to show you a couple of approaches, how do you do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're working with you, sexy, and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer us is, well?
Does we know why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not just to us, not just to be able to study their grandchildren, but also tell us that their pinsy structure, the little structure in our bones, because it's important to understand the supernovae and treat.
And when you tell that what you do, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
Now, the arguments are a contradiction to understanding your thoughts.
Do you know, you could use it in time and time, but why don't you just say "Cace and time," what's much more profound for us?
We're trying to make your thoughts understand, not the same thing you're going to cut down.
As Einstein said, "Hoo things like this, but not easier."
You can be able to tell us about your scientific field without having to deal with trade.
A few things are actually about looking at: examples, stories and analogies, so in this way, you can put into your mind.
And if you're looking at your work, you'll take the numbers away.
Have you ever wondered why it means "Wall"?
What happens if someone's going to mind? Another one is going to be a while, and with those first dots you're going to have your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits very much on the discussion of our brain, and it's very confusing.
This example of Gene BonT is much more effective. It shows that the particular structure of the pelpage is so stable that it was even the inspiration of the Hubble.
The trick here is to use a single bit of simple sentence, if the audience loses the arrow, it can be able to break, and it also makes the pictures and the images that are also making our other sense of understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few attempts that help us open up the door and see the miracles of the country that science and technology.
Because the engineers I've taught, I've taught myself to make a very tight contact in my own, I want to combine everything with a equation.
If you look at your science and you're looking at your textbooks and you're talking about the most compelling, the audience is important, and what's important, and you've been able to do with the passion of your incredible work, and it's something that's very sophisticated, very sophisticated, very sophisticated, very sophisticated interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really afraid of it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can see a cell phone with a cell phone, and you can actually film a crime in the human position of the human being.
You can put a phone phone with a message and start a meeting in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can put it in soundboard, and you'll be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1986, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of people are going to change on the road and document.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we've been asking that all these people who were coming up and asked to change, a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Don't take it up.
Do you want your cell phones high, keep it up!
Don't take it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
These are many. Almost every cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines full information.
Super-based data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.K. Recess has signed a line.
This is the climate change that's called the law of the U.S.
This is the rule of the Internet that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service service service in Europe, has to store a range of anti-preated information.
Who does who call who? Who is sending a email?
Who is going to send a text message?
And if you're using a cell phone, where you're.
All of this information is made for least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet services.
And all over Europe, people are coming up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to fight this foreign trade.
We want to be a self-of-art-dimensional age, and we don't want to have the phone companies and Internet services all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, journalists, the priests who all said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people on the streets of Berlin and said, "Food, rather than fear."
And some people even said that could be on the Stina 2.0.
The Stina was the pelodial in the East Ocean.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can all this information have to store all of us?
Every time I use my phone?
So I asked my phone company company, the Encyclopedia Project, which was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, all of you will have done with me.
And I asked them once, and they asked them, and they didn't get a right answer. It's just too cold,
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that you've been doing with it.
So I decided to put a court trial against it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the Italian telecom said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going to keep the waist behind what they all got to do with me.
Because in the meantime, the federal government attack decided that the introduction of E.K. was the wrong law of the German law.
So I got this ugly brown, with a CD.
And on the CD, this was what it was.
35.830 points on information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a big record. My hand is.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
These are six months of my life in this report.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you can see where I'm sleeping at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information on public.
I want to do them published.
Because I want to show people what's called the U.S. movement.
So with time and online, open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom down and zoom down, you can go back and down.
You can take a step of every step I do, to track.
And you can even see how I'm going to drive from Frankurt, and how many calls I'm going to go on.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like, I call my wife and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then I'll say a couple of friends and they'll call each other.
And after a while, you call it and you call it in and we have this giant communications network.
But you can see how people communicate together with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see it all.
You can see the central symbols, like who the leaders are the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who a email, all of that is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said to the beginning, we've been looking at all these people in the streets of Alfins in 1989, cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stah had known who was in the demonstration, and when the Stahah had had had had had had had been, the leaders would have never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall Bank, maybe not even happened.
And also, not the case of the ironical curtain.
Because today, the national agency and companies are going to store so much information, how they can get over us, online and so on.
They want to have the possibility of looking at our lives, and they want to store all the time long-term.
But self-interest and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you'll say that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you'll say your CEO, just because companies and government, you have a certain amount of information, you don't need to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to the information they've been stored on you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight the self-dimensional self-dimensional self-dimensional.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central Central: Beal-freating, rapid-time, concrete space.
So the city plan is to meet and change the name of South Central Africa so it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Sortical fruit stores, rapid restaurants, concrete spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food of South Central Los Angeles, the home of Dr.
The great thing is that the Drivist is that the Drivist is killing more people than the Dr.
People die in South Central Central Los Angeles in unrelated diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in Hony Mountains, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even meet that anymore.
And I asked myself how to feel if you had no access to healthy food every time you go from the house, the negative effects of the food system on your neighborhood.
I'm going to make sure that snail flies bought and sold as a drone.
I see the entertainment centers of the way Starbucks is flying.
And I realized that that's what it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't think about 45 minutes of the time to get a apple that's not involved with the pesticide.
So I planted a food bomb before my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park.
It's 45 feet tall.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to have to be involved.
So I think, "Tool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it in the position."
And I decided to keep it in the state.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green. And we started to plant my food, and fruit trees, so the whole program, the vegetables.
We are a kind of a set of super-preating group, together from all social layers and all the city, it's completely rewarded and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else has been concerned.
The city came to me, and he was basically given me a crossboard, and he said that I have to get my garden, the stock attack was a popular act.
And I thought, "Okay, do you know?
A popular deal with growing food in a piece of food that's completely true to you?"
And I thought, "Tool. Her hand."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind. Steve Lope did a story about the city of the city and a member of green to Green Zero. You had a bomb on the top of the top.org and 140,000 distractions. We were successful.
We thought the victory in the hands.
My city of mine, even in fact, said they support it and love what we do.
So, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. There's the most open spaces in the United States in the community.
They have 10,000 miles of concrete.
These are 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why would they not find that good?
and by growing a plant, you'll get 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
With green, the green are in the value of a dollar, you'll get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my bossal, I'll say people are going to grow their own food.
His own food is how their own food is to print their own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew up my sons.
And I'm more interested in being part of this preconceical reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm a artist.
All the work is my graffiti. I'm wearing my art.
It's just like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm going to put lawns and park.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my most disrelatedness for this stuff.
They were surprised to be surprised what the Earth is possible if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunshine is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was a instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wondering how children are influenced by it.
The humanities is the most primitive and the most cool act that you can do in the middle of the city.
And you can also get straw.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came out, it was about 10 to 10 to 10 o'clock in my backyard, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't need to do that.
The garden is not just not just the reason on the road."
I've been shocked when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that only has me been able to do it. People asked me, "You don't fear that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "I'm a god, no, no, I didn't fear that they're laughing.
It's also the way it's on the road.
But that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want to take it back to your health."
I took a garden in this homeless garden in the garden.A.
These are the guy who helped me to put the cart.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced and how they had their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it has changed, even though it's just a moment.
Green Gres have been able to grow about 20 gardens.
and in our way to our nepids, we've been able to get 50 people and do all of these volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, babies eat gas.
When they grow green, they eat tomato.
But if they didn't get it, if they don't get to see how food and body and body, they eat blind, whatever you're going to do.
I see young people who want to work in this thing, but they're color-like children that are exactly the same way they're in the path that they're in the same direction that they're in.
The color of the day, I see as a chance of learning that we can train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could put the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole remote neighborhood of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take the ship license and turn it into healthy cafeteria.
So, don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
The fun thing about sustainability is that you have to keep it through it.
I'm talking about getting people working work and children from the streets, and they're the pleasure and the honor of being able to learn when you're building their own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want to say that we all become ecological, the gang, the gangiest.
We have to turn the picture of the gang's cliffs.
If you're not a vist, you're not a gang.
You're going to be able to get a pist, clear?
And let's get the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me with me, don't tell me if you're in a lot of crap and you want to go and take a meeting where you talk about it, you're going to make some laugh.
If you want to meet me, you're going to get your skug, in my backyard so that we can plant some of them.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the world of Oxford English is "nnnnnolly Monologry."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "Snnnolic Monology," means "nivious politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper interview of a better definition, "Aaaolly, somebody who is a foreign party, independent party or a program, or a program, and its success of the dominant force of the dominant disregion.
I have no idea what "pillal is."
Something like, I think, in other words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
In 1771, for example, the British Parliament, had not been able to test the word "sood" on the Revood."
And that was actually where the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Catayby, which was in the parliament.
They were throwing it in the jungle in London, and they had a shame, and he was courageous enough to stop the search, and finally he had so much support in London.
And just a few years later, we've found the first propination for the sentence "woody" a lot of people.
Brel is the word of the English word for a poo.
But that's not true. It's going back to a convicted of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you in the United States to take you back to the time when it's just been the independence.
You saw the question of how to say George Washington, the state of the state, the state of the state.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader a popular nation?
and this is something that was based on Congress for a long time.
And there was all kinds of possible suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the govern West, and others, his grandness of George Washington, and again, other, the freedom of the United States of America.
Not that kind of a real.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that's true.
They weren't monologicist, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period.
It could have been working.
But everybody was uncomfortable, because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the days of a writer that is constantly writing "I've got the same issue."
The reason for the failure was the most frustrating and the most exciting thing was that the most popular house was against the Senate.
The most popular director of the House didn't want Washington's house. They didn't want to.
King says, and it might be even given to ideas of its after.
They wanted to give him the most scary, the most popular title that they could find.
This title was "A Recess."
President. They didn't invented the title. It didn't even mean that somebody had been thrown out of a board.
So something like the charity of a jury.
He didn't have more size than the "pood Life," or "pood water."
Sometimes, the president had small ethnic and government groups, but it was really a unfinished title.
That's why the Senate stopped him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy has to confront the argument and the foreign payments.
Who will take it seriously if he has a stupid title like President of America's United States?"
And also after three weeks, the Senate didn't have been on.
Instead, we didn't want to use the word "The Unconce" by the word "The Uncess," but they wanted to be aware of it, because they didn't agree with their honest and civil institutions, whether it's in the state of the state of the state of the state, or the state of the world, that it's not necessarily the leader of the rest of the world, and the world is responsible for the rest of the world.
You can learn three interesting things.
First of all -- and I think that's the best -- until now I can't find out if the U.S. has ever been given the title of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just been the title of his boss. He's just waiting for the war.
The second thing is that if a government says that something temporary is -- you're going to wait to have 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States of America is not just so uncomfortable, right?
This has been doing something more than 5,000-fat-fat-freated, and the largest economy of the world and a drone drone drone drone and all this stuff.
and the truth and story has given the title of the size.
And so the Senate won the end.
They have a very respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the call of self-sood, now it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
141.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear bombs and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won the most popular house, because nobody feels shocked when one said that you're going to be the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'll leave you with that.
Now, politicians are trying to use words to form reality and to control reality, but actually the reality of the words that we've ever ever ever changed more than the words of reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a paster with about 50 volataline in the fight of the Slaalabad -- a 12-year-old, a Hungarian, monopoly of Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm looking at my black pianist with a small leathery leather and a rocket in the process of government war.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I had been able to get a lot of time before the war, but on the Thooama party and football and singing with the South African world and the scientific dictatorship, which had no public support and lived with Afghanistan, and the re-freating of Afghanistan, and the knowledge that I knew before.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm here, a more talented Agar, South U.S. Congood, a atheist and a radical sociist artist who's been working on the last nine years in Afghanistan, and has been working in Afghanistan.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, there are a lot of great things to do with art, but I'm personally playing a cold-up, I want to make art, and the authority and the content and the clarity of the reality and the design of the experience of the people that we're trying to try to understand in the world.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- who is going to put its jihad against the "Pololian Dood" and rape religious and political corruption in order to keep it.
And what else can the jihad be done when the parliament was to pay for the parliament and make a choice campaign with the Pantheon, "Did I do a jihad."
And try to use this campaign to get these Ma-Dikiiii who spend a national lady.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rood," where you're going to be a cow, a false control of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking money for money and money, and give them money to the police police in Kabul, and the police of the police, and that they hope that they hope they will help them.
I want to look at how conflict in Afghanistan, I think, was a "Citiian conflict."
The war and the strange view that came with him, a new environment for Style and fashion, which is just using a fashion of soldiers and suicide bomber, where I'm using the local farm of local Afghan and a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a compendable and a non-pidable, a non-preated, a non-pidable, a non-pidable, a non-p
And I would like to see how a simple trick from Kabul, from the 18th-century app, to create a dialogue about that today's development of the international international, in the last-downing of the man, the man of the white man, to protect the white man of the man, and even to protect him a lot of freedom.
But for all these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood, misre aware.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self.
This is my head. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Marx and I've been working on a model for a while.
For 10 years, just before 10 years, they said.
I feel like this is a really uncomfortable tension in the room because I didn't have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit of change.
This is the first time someone is going to put a look at the TED stage, so you can be happy to see what I think.
If a few women were really really hard when I came out, you don't need to say that now, I read it later on Twitter.
I also think that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short seconds of what you think about me.
That's not what everybody has.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them before.
The hardest part is to take the pid of my head, because you'll all be able to let me do anything, so it's not as long as it's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it wasn't so uncomfortable as this picture.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also flat.
I've just changed your opinion in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I had never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to put my back oil and with my hand in this guy.
And besides the surgery of surgery or the wrong brest, I've been able to change two days ago, there are very few ways of changing our fears, and our fears -- even though it's unregular and unregable -- a big impact on our lives.
It's a fear of being honest for me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
Now, I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but on the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you create a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh, I've discovered it," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic pandemic and a critical legacy, and you might ask what that legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and primitive and symmetrical, we are designed by the confusion of ignorance, but also as big, and white and white.
This legacy was created for me. And it's an legacy that's paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical to this point. And maybe some fashion-daughterers like, "Hol. Naol, Hans, Slan.
And first, I'm talking about your model fiction. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious student in the year of Time, all the things that have been counted on the front of the length, every single single one that was taken off of the hundred7 micro-foot-and-and-and-and-old, and that the only 27 percent of them were not known.
The next question I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And first of all, I said, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I'd like to give these little girls is, why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can be the president of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja-Man-law, which was completely crazy, because you're the first one."
If they still say about this great, "No, Watson, I want to become a model," I say, "Hake my boss."
Because I didn't have responsibility for nothing, and you could be the CEO of American bird bird bird War or the business leader of H<unk>amp;MI, or the next Steven Meis.
And to say that you want to be a model later, that's like, if you want to say that you want to win the Jack's drug in the serist.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of the model of the future, because it can be more like heart attack, it's just happening.
If there's a photographer, and the light is exactly like a nice thin, and the customer says, "Told, we want to go back to the house, and then the first thing is, and the arm is going back to the back, and the end of that arm is moving back to the back, and you can move back to the back, and you can just take it back to 300 friends, and you can just get it's just start to be able to be
It looks like this.
Hopefully, less weird than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what's happening.
If you're going to leave school and you've done a lot of jobs, you can't say, if you want to be President American America, but you want to be in life, but you're looking at the life of the year, you're looking at it weird.
The next question I'm often asked is, "Who all the photos are going to be rejected?"
And yes, so much of all the photos are suspended, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photo I've done, and that was also the first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
And that's how I saw a few months ago, with my grandmother.
This is the day I'm the Shud.
My girlfriend had to be shocked by me.
This is me on a silly gentleman party, a few days ago for a French bird bird.
This is me with the football team and the V-A magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not images of me.
They're design, and they're a group of professionals, from Haphene and machine scientists and photographers and the Stylologists and all their courses and the posts and the production and the production. They're not.
Okay, next, the next thing is, people always ask me, "Where are you doing things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-degree notes I can never wear, except the things I'll get free, are things I'll get in real life and talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had lost my money. And you had a dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I went to my girlfriend with a terrible driver, and she was stopped a red light, and of course we had just been stopped. It was just a -- "Hear, Mr. Teszler, Mr. Teszler, and we could go back.
I have this costless stuff because of my personality, and there are people who are looking at their appearance and not because of their personality, and not for their personality.
I live in New York and the 140,000 teenagers who were beaten and broke out in the last year, 85 percent of black and Latino and most young men.
It's only in New York, it's only 177 young, male and Latino, who doesn't say, "Did I stop?"
But, how often do I leave? When I'm stopped?"
And in my research, I found out that in this talk, that 23 percent of all the women in the United States don't like their body. And this number is going to be up on the north of the 25 percent when they're 17.
The last question I'm asking is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit of thin hair, you feel very happy and great."
And we'll give a answer that might be sent to this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great, creative, inspiring people."
Everything is true, but it's just half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, what I said was, "I feel uncomfortable."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Did I have a happy, if I had thin legs and gloom?"
And then you should meet some of the micro-creatings, because they have the thin legs and the coolest hair and the coolest ones and they are the ones that are probably the way they look at the planet.
When I've been preparing this talk, it was very difficult to get me to a very honest balance, because at the end, I felt very uncomfortable, and I would say, "I got all the benefits of my little pile of mine, and it's also not very hard to make it happy."
It was very difficult to capture an legacy of gender and race when I'm one of the biggest payload of it.
But I'm also happy, and I feel proud to be here, and I think it's great that before 10 or 30 years ago, and my career is still still still still still still still more disrelated, because I would say, I would not say how my first job was, or maybe I would have been paid to tell you about what's so important.
If you take something from this talk, I hope we all have the power of the image in our discouraging and disengfortively.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who came to life in the exroquic, "Son, the Safiiism.
But I'm never going to be like a Gafafi revolution."
It's now almost two years since the Congolian revolution, inspired by the waves of mass mass mass mass mass events and both in the Egyptian revolution.
I was in a lot of other people, in and outside and outside, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrant regime.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, the Thad women and men were in the first row, the end of the regime, was, "wogan, dignity and social justice in the air.
They have shown the most compelling courage by giving the most vulnerable dictator of Gafafis.
They have shown a strong sense of mass, from the far east of the West, until the south.
And finally, after a period of six months of cold war, and almost 50,000 dead, we managed to break our country and reduce the tyranny.
But Gafi has left a big repertoire, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation of the course.
Over four decades, Gafafic regime has destroyed both the infrastructure, as the cultural structure of the Syian society.
The confusion and the challenges of the challenges, I would have been able to build as many other women, to build civil society, and we asked the question of a legitimate and re-preated transition to democracy.
In fact, 200 organizations were founded during the case of Gafah in Benvhaz, almost 300 in Trowolis.
After 33 years in the Enril, I came back to Lyvia, and with a unique mess, I started to organize the relationship of human development and leadership.
And with a wonderful group of women, I started the peace of Bry Women, a movement of women, leaders of different life, whose goal is to be the CEO of women's rights, and to our right-to-being of democracy.
In the financial elections, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more polarized. A environment that was defined by the selfish politics of the law of the law of the law.
I led a initiative of peace platform to get a nonprofit leader to get a nonprofit choice, a law of every citizen, no matter what the right is to choose with the right, and to take a good job and to the political leaders between female leaders and the vertical line and the vertical line of female, and to bring a more open-up, and to the end-to-to-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex
And at the end of our initiative, our initiative was over and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation's state of the first elections since 52 years.
But very clear, the euphemial conflict of elections and the whole revolution, because every day we were looking for new news from violence.
We were looking for a morning to the re-pood of contemporary and the Sufi.
On another morning, we got the message about the murder of American Prime Minister and the attack on the message.
And back to another morning, the suicide bomber was the army of the army.
And we really kept in the leadership of the first day, and our common and their common-being of the human being and their laws of law and laws.
Our society, of course, is created by a revolutionary state of institutionality, polarized by the ideals of the ideals and the freedom of freedom, dignity, social justice, which they had at the beginning.
Beability, mastery and rugging was too much of the idiolime era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success of our success of our pre-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-war.
In fact, I'm here to suggest that we've met a nation of a nation that had false choice and the wrong choices.
We did false things.
Because the elections didn't have peace or safety in Lyia.
Did the real-up-up and the change between female and female leaders and nationalization?
No, she didn't.
What's it?
Why will our society continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics and the end of the cause of men and women?
Maybe women were not the only one who stopped, but the female values of empathy, the Gnood, and the act.
Our society needs a national dialogue and engineering process as they needed the elections that only has supported the polarization and the deconination.
Our society needs the most ambitious repertoire of the female as the most effective, neutralness of the female.
We have to stop talking to the name of the anger and ask a day of the hell.
We have to start in the name of compassion and the Gnood.
We have to develop a female comment on which the values not only to be honest, but also, like, Goodn, instead of collaboration, instead of competition, instead of re-expitting.
These are the ideals of the ideals that a war-sated can be helpful to achieve peace.
Because the peace has a alchemic and in this alchemic, it's about the defending and the pony and the picder of the humor.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do that in general, before we do it, we need to do it with the sociological.
After a lie from the Koran "Salam," peace "The word of the most good God, haw haw."
The word "The World War" again, which is known in all the late metadian traditions, has the same Greek root of "inach," and symbolization of the dead, the whole human being, the man of the rich and the female who all of the people who are all over.
And just like the mother's mother's heart attack, which is growing in him, completely the reason of compassion.
And so we said, "My God is all about it."
And so I said, "My God, had been rejected by my sood."
Are we going to all be able to get the Soodah's Sood.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Near."
And I was very proud.
In school, we've been looking at the story of Kim Il, but we didn't learn a lot about the world, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I was a lot of time thinking about how the world world is, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all the time to change.
And at seven years, I saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to suffer myself.
But in the year of 2007, my mother brought a letter with a colleague named a colleague.
And this is, "If you're going to be here, our five family members are not going to be there for the world because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're in the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're soon dying."
I was so shocked.
I heard about this for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
At a short time, I went to the board, and I saw something terrible that I can't be able to cut away from my memory.
A cold woman was on the ground, and a half-legged kid in her arm, in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were so busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million north of the war, and many more of them were still dying because they ate grass, and the elephant and the ocean.
If you're going to have a lot more than the weight of the time, it's all so hard to make me out of the lights of China, the other side of the planet, where we've been living.
I always wondered why they had lights and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors in night.
This is the river of the Arctic, the part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very disenged, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the river.
I can't say a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the late-term age of the genocide of China.
I just thought I would be separated by my family for a short time.
I had never thought it's only needed in 14 years to work.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be as North Carolina, but soon I learned that it's not just very difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen as a foreign immigrant in China.
So I lived in the constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me into a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest Alath Life was true when I was caught by the Chinese police police, and I was sent to the police department.
Somebody was given me to be North Bronx, so they tested my Chinese, and asked me a lot of questions.
I was afraid of that fear, I thought my heart would explode.
If anything is unlimuous, I could be trapped and unacted.
I thought that was the end of my life, but I made my emotions and answer questions.
After they were ready with the questions, a leader said, "That was a false failure.
It's not a Northman."
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China, he's looking at foreign messages called polyyl, but many of the Chinese police police police are caught.
These girls had great happiness.
Although they were caught, they finally got released by massive international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, many northern northern Indians are caught in China and they're released to North Korea, or they're being replicated or in public.
Although I had been very lucky at my happiness, it's not like many other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard to survive.
and after they've learned a new language and work, their world can be asked to be asked to the head.
And after 10 years of the confusion of the panic, I decided to go back to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
I was able to let in South Korea, a bigger challenge, when I had thought about it.
English was so important in South Korea, that I had to start learning my third language.
And I also found the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but in the inside, we've been very close to ourselves, because of the 20 years, we're part of the part of the project.
I was in a identity crisis.
Am I the South and North Centralman?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the connection to the beautiful Southwest life, I had a plan.
I was involved for the record of the university.
Just as I was more interested in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Bronx State Bank, the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family was moved to a remote place in the country.
They had to be able to be able to run as fast as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to go back to a remarkable route to the path of freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, ironically, I took a flight back to China and made me on the way to the Northwest border.
Because my family didn't talk to Chinese, I had to fight them on more than 2,000 miles of China and then to South Asia.
The bus bus took a week, and we've been nearly caught in a few times.
Once a month, the bus was in the bus, a Chinese police police police police police officer came in.
He took the out of all, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese officer, my family leader, I was elected, and he said that they were too cold, and I was the conversation of her.
He looked at me in a pre-quist, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to go to the bottom, but I had to almost keep all my money to make the border of Luk.
But even after we've been in the border, my family was covered because of illegal border.
After I had paid money and paid paid money, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family was replicated in the capital of Lora.
This was one of the biggest distraction of my life.
I had done everything to resist my family to freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested, just before the South Bronx.
I went to the Department of the U.S. and the police department, and I was trying to let my family, but I had no money to pay money back and pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is concerned with it.
In a broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and didn't want to kill a bank, and paid the money for my family and two and two of them to get out of jail.
I thank him about the most conscious heart, and I asked him, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said.
"I'm going to help the northern African people."
I realized that this was an icon in my life.
The last one that I've been talking about is a new hope for me who was so much so much less likely to have the North Koreans, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of international community as the only one that the North Koreans need.
And finally, after our long journey, my family and I was back in Southern Korea, but the freedom is just a step.
Many north-anans are separated by their families, and once they come into a new country, they start with no money.
The international community can help us to learn in education, the English education of education and many more.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of the world, because many of us are still in contact with families, and we send information and money to change the city of North Korea.
I had so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I want to be honest to fight the Northern Koreans, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see a lot of successful North Koreans all over the world, but also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just got a request today.
Please say, "I'm normal.
Now, I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Si is 22, and very good.
It can't talk, but it's also learning pleasure in a way that it can't be the best speaker.
Si knows what love is.
It's very disregulated, and it's also putting it out.
It's not a bit of hard. It's not looking at the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and you just ask yourself, he's never told a lie.
If he's been listening to our childhood, it's not even when I remember myself, it reminds me that one thing: how little we know about the minds and how wonderful the unknown of the unknown.
Samuel is 16. It's very good.
It has absolutely absolutely unconditionable memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he's wearing my chocolate bomber, but he reminds me that after every song of my iPod, conversations that we had had had been four of the first shocking of my arm, and the first thing that he had been able to put my arm on my arm and the Kagamam birthday.
Don't you hear it amazing?
But many people don't want to be honest.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit in social version of normal, they're often going to be understood and wrong.
But what my heart was encouraged, and my soul was that, although that was the case, even though they were not as popular, that was just one that they were extraordinary -- I was not naive.
Now, for those of you who are not familiar with the term "existism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that influenced social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's in every individual, it's kind of like Dani is different.
And the world is probably 20 minutes in a new person with autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing areas of the world, there's no case or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm a neuroscientist, but I can't remember it without any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that it was different.
He was very much.
He didn't want to play the same time it did other babies, and in fact, he didn't think of me.
Si lived in his own world, and he was in his own world, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars in a series of space, to eat the machine and eat everything that's coming under it.
And when he was older, he became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger of the rape and the savanna and the never end of hyperactivity was a really simple, a cruel and innocent nature, a boy who had no doubted the world, a human being.
Except, extraordinary.
Well, I can't be aware that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were exactly like me.
But I'm going to go back with the thought of things that they taught me about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I would not want to be responsible for normism.
So the normality of beauty is that the differences that we give us, and the fact that we are different, is not that one of us is wrong.
It's just that there's another kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing about Dani and to Sam and you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, with children or autistic, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everyone has a gift in us. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate potential of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change in the moment where we try to be like somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Doc Ed Edon has been engaged with curiosity and curiosity, with this photo, a apple of a shark bomb and with a war of an 80-percentth-th-century event.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and you can't see the world with a million or a billion image, but a trillion image per second.
I'll give you a new kind of photography that can be a new kind of photography photographer, a new engineering engineering that is so fast that it can be able to create time of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that are able to look at the view of our view or not a <unk>-ray in our body and really ask what we're doing with a camera.
Now, if I take a laser clip and take it into a second, and we're looking at it in a decade of second -- these are several short-seconds, I'll make a paper of photons that is hardly a millimeter, and this photon is a mile of the technology, and that is going to be able to move into light, and it's going to be a speed of a new project.
So, if you take this project, this photocon piece of photon, and you can take it in this bottle, how these photons are going to break into the bottle?
How do light look like in time in slow motion?
So this whole event -- this whole event.
So, think about this, this whole event actually takes less than a nanoscopic event -- so long to take the light back to that route, but I've been trying to get this video to the 10 billion minutes so that you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola has not funded this research.
So in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what's going on.
The pulse, our project, is in the bottle of a photonon piece that starts moving through the inside and ultimately the inside.
A part of the light is flowing down on the table, and you see this spread of waves.
A lot of photons are finally going to get the extraction of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's going to be in the bottle of the bottle.
And in the same time, the waves on the table, and because of the reflection of the screen, the reflection of the bottle of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a conventional project, and you can take it back to the same route and slow the video back to 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in movement.
And how do it look like something with something that's still a while-up photographer?
You can see again, how these waves of the table, the Tom's wall and the wall on the background.
It's when you put a stone in a pond.
I was like this, as I was able to paint the nature of the way that a photo, every single-up image, but of course, our eye is a series of view.
But if you look at this Tom's now, you can see that when the light is going to be swallowed by Tom's, that's going to be completely different.
Why is that? Because Tom is now released, and the light is moving around in their own, and it's going to come back to a hundred seconds.
So in the future, if this Fow-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-Row, it could be possible that you can go into a supermarket and see if a fruit is not a fruit attack,
So how did my team built my team at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you're going to take a photo of long-term waste, you've got very little light, but we're going to have a billion times faster than your short-term waste, so you'll get it like that.
So what we do is we're sending this project, this photocon piece, a thousand times, and then you're looking back and combine very clever processing the data of these terabytes of data, and we're going to make these extra video videos that I've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future super-based superheroes: can you see parts?
The idea is that we're going to put something on the door.
It's going to be replicated in the space, a part of it is moving back to the door, and ultimately we could use this more extra bit of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you can see our F-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-
On the wall, a pic is hidden in the wall, and we'll let the light on the door.
After our paper in the "The Encyclopediaications," it was released by Nature.com.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light project, and we'll put it into this wall, and these photons are all over the directions, and some of the photons are going to be able to get our hidden pest, and then the light, and then the back, and then the back of the bridge is a bit of light, and then we'll be able to get a light closer to the light of the light, and then it's going to be able to
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our F-L-R-R-R-R. has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time of processing, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know that by the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is about the distance.
By taking a laser, we can take a laser, we can take a concrete picture that you see -- not really complicated sense -- but if we take many of these pictures, many of these pictures, and try to analyze the different light, and try to analyze the different light, then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our creationization.
We have a lot of things to do before we could actually build the lab in practice, we could actually use cars that are able to detect what's behind the curve, or to look at dangerous losses, by looking at the light, and to look at the light, or to see the fly, or we can build the end of the end of the surface, and we can build the surface of the body in the body, and the body of the body.
But because of the pel and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, so that's really a game call for scientists, now, about the F-Tow-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Dapse, because the next generation of medical science could solve the future.
So, like in Docon, a scientist, even a science of art, a graphic photography of the hyper-dimensional photography, and I realized that all these terabytes of data that we could not use just a new picture of science, and we can also create a new computer of the computer of the computer, and we can only look at the time, and we can't look at that layer of light, and we can look at that layer of these light, and see that light
But it's also something weird about this.
If you look at these waves under the glass, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should be moving to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've been able to take almost light effects, weird effects and Einstein would have seen this picture of incredible.
The order of magnitude in the world are going to be in the back-up order, so by using the relationship of space and time, we can fix that intuition.
So, whether you're going to focus on photography or to create a new visual framework for medicine or new construction, since our invention, we all have made data and open the details of our website and hope that the creative and the creative community and the creative community of the new insights that we should be able to understand in our next generation, and to start to start to start to start to explore the next two dimensions.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibilities of how our people can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many arguments are not going to be passed away. But we use the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like a little bit of dets and chalk and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much money pay my neighbors?
How do we abuse more things without each other?
How do we share our memories on the limitations of the buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities are changing our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is dominated by the giant eod, which has been really afraid of hundreds of young, quiet and dissonic shadows. I trust a city where music is always.
I think every time someone never said, there are in New Orleans, a paragraph.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city of most of the people in America.
I live in the place where this house and I thought about how to make it more, and I thought it's also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death, and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a great grateful happiness for my life, and it brought me clarity about things that are important in life.
But it's hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose your daily life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I moved a page of the house in a giant box, and I wrote a cross-up of the gaps: "I want to keep my -- every one of which can take a piece of paper, and think about his life and think about his hopes of life.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do in the experiment, but the whole day the wall was completely filled, and it grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you who were written by people's wall.
"Do I die, I want to be distracted by the irrational."
"Tell me I'm hungry, I want to stand on the International Recessation."
"Do I hate to sing for millions of people."
"Do I drink, I want to plant a tree."
"Tell me to die, I want to live "weal" in gay."
"Tell me I'm hungry, I want to keep them in my poor."
"Do I hate to be a guy's Cavry."
"Tell me I'm hungry, I'd like to be myself."
This is a place that was reported to a meaningful place, and the hopes of people and dreams of the people, to laugh, to the wine and the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and to make a new and more practical way.
It's about creating space for thinking and remember what's most important when we grow and change.
I've done this last year, and I've got hundreds of great news messages of their community, so my colleagues and I've created a building software, and now in the world, in the world, South Central Africa, Asia, and other walls.
We've shown how much power of our public spaces when we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships in other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever to look at the things that are looking at the right-hand view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often going to talk about death or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the effort of death is one of the things that most of us are protected.
The idea of death is that we're looking at life.
Our common places are the best places that we are important as individuals and citizens, and with more opportunities, fears and stories, can't help us to help us to help better places, to help us live better, to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm interested with the most ambitious math. A special problem for everybody who is busy with the most ambitious math, is that we're like a business worker.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to try to explain today about what I do.
Stine is one of the most common activities.
We're excited about the blind ball and the boomers and the way you're going to see.
On the ballett, a remarkable amount of evidence and abilities and abilities, and maybe a basic principle that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's so slow up with Parkinson's extraordinary ability. It's also called the Grest Levese Convime, which was a ball of time to the time that a ballet.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer in this disease, and they have to have to live with the unhealthy symptom of the anticination, the poodess, the pugia and other others that causes this disease. And so we need to discover the objective of the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only possibility is, is, is, is, whether there's cure, if we have a objective measure that question.
In trouble, there are too many natural movements and other movements of Parkinson's flexibility, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and it means outside clinical studies that never made.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a pre-pid tour in the hospital. What if patients could make this test even?
It wouldn't need to be a private hospital.
It's also about 300 percent of the way that it's going to be able to study the neurologic field.
So I want to suggest to you about a non-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex
So here's a video of the vibratory sounds.
This is what happens in normal state, if someone's writing sounds. We can look at the misprepine ball, because we need to adapt all of these muscles, and we all have the genes for it. For example, for example, if you have the genes.
And how ballet does it need a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to talk until it's learning.
and by looking at the sound, we can turn the position of the vibratory odor, and the way the limb is also affected by Parkinson's disease.
On the bottom of the top, you can see an example of unregular mood processes.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Right, it's true, earmess, cumity.
The language is even more gentle and cold, and that's an example of it.
Now, this impacts on the voice can be trivial, sometimes with digital micro-dimensional and informal software, with new machine learning learning, which is now very advanced, we can now see where somebody is in a disease between the disease and the health of the disease, just because of the mood.
How can these tests measure these clinical trials? Well, they're not selfish. The test is actually called neurologists.
It's a little bit. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And they're exactly exactly exactly exactly true. They're not doing the same thing of experts.
So they can be done by yourself.
They're very fast, just 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in big scale.
Now, this amazing goals, we can do this.
We can reduce rational difficulty for patients.
So patients don't have to do a temporary control in the hospital.
We can be able to gain objective data through the more dramatic observation.
We can do low-cost mass-cost mass-term intervention for clinical trials, and first of all the population is possible.
Now, we have the possibility to look for biomimicry for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start to start using Parkinson's disease.
With Acill and patients and patients, we'd like to take a very high number of voices on the world to have enough data data to have the goals of that goals.
We have a reputation number that are accessible to the three-dimensional number of people on the planet.
Everyone, with no Parkinson's disease, can be called cheap to leave pictures for a few cents. I'll give you a lot of joy that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of samples, we'll take 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to be attacked while the call, whether that person is suffering in Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be able to get it until the end.
But we collect a huge database in particular different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we are also to figure out what the actual text is for Parkinson's disease.
At the time, they have 86 percent accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thisis -- I have to make it so fantastic work, because now it's also working on the cell phone network, which is what this project allows us to do, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a function of improvement.
That means that people can -- people can call the phone with the phone, and people might call it with Parkinson's voice, they can let their doctor to test the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. Dan Bob, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the eastern Central National Park.
and in the background, you can see the cows of my father and the lettuce is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a series of viewing in the south. That means that wildlife animals can rely on the park at any time.
The predators that are lions, they follow them. And they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who died in night. I woke up in the morning, and she was dead. It was terrible. It was our only snail.
My tribe, the tribe of the Asianai, believes that we came together with our animals and the Arctic Ocean, so that's why our animals are so much so much.
I was also a kid who I learned to hate lions.
Our warrior is called Marans. They protect our tribe and our neighbor. They're also trained by this problem.
and kill lions.
This is one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi, there's only so many lions.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years of his father's father. That's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that we didn't really help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't have to do it. I did it.
I had a second idea. I tried to write it with a bird bird.
I wanted to think that lions thought I was going to go to the cow.
But lions are very clever animals.
You can see the bird's watch and go back and forth. But at the next time, they come and they come, and they're not going to get the thing, it's still true.
And they're going to take away and kill our livestock.
I was looking at the cliffs at the night. I went up with a pub in the hand and I didn't get the lions.
lions feared light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working on a little boy, and I used all the day in my room, and even a time of my mother, my mother, and the day she took me almost me. But I had learned a lot of electronics.
I took a old car battery and a motor driver of a motorcycle. It shows if you want to turn down the right or left. It's a cold.
And I got a switch to turn the lights and turn it into.
This is a little bit of a snub in a cric bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar-in-in-electric, the battery takes electricity to the right. I call it a transpite.
And the policy of the open-down.
You can see that the drop of smoke is because there are lions.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are bright, and the lions believe that I'm going to go to the front. And I was all the time in bed.
Thank you.
I've been working on this for us, and since we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was the grandmother.
She had lost a lot of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could use their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I've been putting the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
I've been working on seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they're really working well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, but also for other predators like fireflies or butterflies. The lights are also also also to keep elephants from the rivers.
My invention was at me for a scholarship at a recent school in Kenya, Brook School of International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helps with donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and we've put the lights in the back, where there's no, and I'll show the people how to use it.
I just took a boy from the wild of his father, and I saw airplanes on me and said, "I'll sit in a day."
And here's where I'm here.
I had to be able to record a plane for my first TED TED.
If I'm big, I want to become a plane engineer and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to have lions. But by my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can cooperate with the side of the bears, with the lions, not.
Ash Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your own.
So you have this scholarship now. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next to the list?
My next invention, now, I work on a motor fence. A electrode?
Yes, I know, electrical nale are invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've been trying to do it before, not -- yes, I've tried to get back to the trial, because I got a break.
All the beginning is hard. Richard Turner, you're special.
We're going to put you on every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in the hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 minutes of my favorite pictures, and not just have done it.
There was no kind of a book of the CEO, no style, no idea of taking a picture. Not even the lighting of the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by the previous tourist.
My story starts as a talk in New York, and my wife did this picture that I'd put my daughter on my first birthday. We were on the corner of 57 and five.
And that's just a year later, we were in New York, and we decided to take the same picture of it.
Well, you can see where this is going on.
When the third birthday of my daughter got closer to my daughter, "Hey, why don't you do Sabina for New York and do it a father-old party to lead the rituals?"
And at the time, we started to ask the temporary tours to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, it's remarkable, like, the gesture is a completely stranger to make his camera.
Nobody ever said no one, and fortunately, nobody has never been able to put a camera with our camera.
At the time, we didn't even know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just a few weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a pre-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-face.
They are also a possibility for us in October, for the time of time and how we change our time and how we're going to change from a year, not just physically, but in the way.
Because even though we do the same picture, our perspective of time is going to be able to get new miles, I can see life with their eyes, how they're dealing with everything, and how they see it.
This very high time we spend something that we expect to expect and expect every year.
Last time we travel, we went back to the travel, and suddenly they were constantly moving out like a red brand on a box of a box of a toy that they had learned as a little kid, at the previous days.
And she told me about her feelings of her feelings that she had been given for five years of that place.
She said she remembered her heart of the chest when she saw nine years ago the campaign.
And now they look in New York schools because they're really trying to study in New York.
And I was very clear. The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you with the idea of taking a active role in the mind of memories.
I don't know how it looks like you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not in a family photo.
I'm always the picture of the picture.
I want to give you all of you today to come to the picture and ask someone, "Would you like, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 20.24, 51.0/26.9/15.2/8.9 (BP=0.977, ration=0.977)
