When I was 11, I was stumbling by the sounds of a nice joy one morning.
My father heard about his little, gray radio show on the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy, and he was pretty unusual about what was then, because the news was mostly depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'm never going to forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban did the power in Afghanistan when I was six years old, and they banned to go to school.
And so I was committing for five years as a boy, and I was commined my older sister who couldn't get himself to a secret school.
And we could go both to school.
We took another way every day so that no one could guess where we went.
We're sitting in the kitchen shop for it to look like we're just going to buy a grocery store.
We've been doing this in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
It was so much of a pleasant, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and then the class suddenly had to fall for a week because the Taliban had been swallowed.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Did they leave us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school anyway.
I was very lucky enough to grow up in a family where education had been important and my daughters were valued.
My grandfather was ahead of his day.
A foreign stranger from a remote province of Afghanistan. He insisted to send my daughter -- my mother to school, and was rejected by his father.
My native mother became a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- look here -- was the first person in his family who had ever received education.
For him, he was always realized that his children would get education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much greater risk of sending his children not to school.
I know that in the years, I was sometimes so frustrated by the Taliban, by our lives, of the quiet fear and the shift of ignorance.
I was good enough to give up, but my father said, "Told, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be displaced in war.
But one thing is always going to keep you. The thing that's inside of it. And even if we have to pay for your blood to your school sales, we're going to do that.
So -- do you want to give up with me?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed over decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have higher degree than the high school degree, and if my family hadn't used so much for my education, I would be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, when I was a proudly seminal of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first to congratulate me.
He's not just a professor of mine, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the one driving him through Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has bigger dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I helped to start from building SOLA, the first and perhaps the only board for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to perceive the potential of all of them.
And see how their parents and fathers belong to them, and my parents, despite all the time, despite the aftercading events.
Like Ahmed Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and she was killed by a bomb on the side of the road for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang, and a voice beated him, if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try it again.
He said, "Take me now if you want to, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your aging and over-expived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often left in the West: behind most of us who succeed, a father is the value of his daughter, and that's what you realize is your success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not going to be important in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are well-versive and compelling to express the hope of their daughters' future, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And under the Taliban, there were a few hundred girls who went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, and it seems like this.
The Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not over time, and the distribution of the U.S. troops is changing everything.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them to encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan for me is a country of hope and the unlimited opportunity, and it reminds me every day the girls who visit the SOLA.
Just like me, they have big dreams.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, even for a living -- my life -- was coined by seven years in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977, I look young, but I'm not -- I've -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working on the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought, 21 years, we're a brilliant good person, and we've done good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples From Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people in Italy, how to build food.
We went to Italian seed in South Africa, in this quunt valley, which leads to Sambesi River, and we taught local citizens to grow Italian tomatoes and mcini and ...
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest in this, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they began to come.
We were amazed that there was no agricultural waste in such a fertile valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't build, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Make time to save people from the starvation."
Of course, everything beautifully in Africa is expressed.
We had these super-valleys of tomatoatoes. In Italy, they got so big in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato tires were spinning and red, over the night, about 200 ponds came from the river and grappling everything.
We said to the Sambrappers, "Oh my God, the Fourber!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were so brilliant in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the English world did, what did was, after I saw what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were feeding the nourber at least.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense we gave to the unmanned African.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a South American economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We have given the African continent a trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read her book.
Rewrite from a African African, what we've done.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionals, and there are only two ways that we deal with people. We inspect them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchical: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisal: I treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called the editor, the boss.
I was stoked when I read the book "Sreall Beautiful" by laughter. He said, above all, in economics, if people don't want help, they leave them alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, opened up a pole, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolatial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people and we invented a system called company promotion, where no one ever gets started, but you're going to be motivated to the local passion worker, the local servant of the local people who have the dream to be better.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put it together with your local community.
We don't work from offices.
We're meeting in cafes. We're meeting in kitchets.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to close friendhood and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for your growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important of humanity.
We're helping them find knowledge because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
I had this case many years ago, and I had this idea: Why, instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have a part, and they will never say in public what they want to do with their money, what they can see.
Design has this light spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to public meetings.
We work to one to do this, to do this, we need to be made a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new profession needs to be created.
This is the hospital physician in the company, the hospital worker who sits with you in the house with your kitchen table and in the cafes, helps you find the tools to transform your passion in a way that you're going to lead your life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was teaching for the time, and I was trying to escape the disengaging flaw, where we're going to tell others what to do.
And so I was walking around the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, I helped my clients. He helped him. He was in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell him to a restaurant in Perth, and he went to the fishermen and said, "You've helped Maori help us?"
I helped these five fishers to work together and sell these wonderful tuna not to a factory in Albany for 60 cents, but to Japan for sushi for 15 dollars. Then farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you could help them. Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I keep the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- -- well, the government says, "Let's do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the process of building.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be on loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter's printer said, "Rock is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and the economy."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch to know what the smartest human man Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get you to one.
You have to provide them discretionion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they'll come in.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
For which one presentation you most applaud tomorrow?
"Cassion, passionate people. You hated this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- the calculated fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open-art realm of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, build, transport, and sub-connected with them.
The technologies don't exist for this.
Who's going to invent this technology for the green revolution? Do universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and they created what would happen in the city of New York in a hundred years. The conclusion was, the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows on this pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get to the people, and it would be impossible to get the crap from six million horses.
Because they went in crap.
and they see 1860 of the dirty technology that makes life invisible from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the U.S. -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology had made the race. There were tiny little factories in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered discretionion.
Otherwise, they don't come and they're talking to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolutely, committed and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all needs to be able to perform three things: to sell the product that needs to be great, the market needs to be great, and the financial publishing needs to be massive.
You guess what?
We never met one person who can produce something at the same time, selling and provide for money.
That doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We did research and we looked at the 100 most iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have all of the successful companies, only one: no one has just been founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 years of training in Northeast entrepreneurship, and we start giving them the lectures to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons's Autobiography, and the task of the 16 years is to support the first two sites by Richard Brans's Autographography, as often as he uses the word "mich" and how many times the word "we" is.
Never "and" and 32 times "we"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator has a small corporation in the cafes and bars, and their dedicated buddy who will do for them, what someone who's done for this gentleman who's talking about this vigram. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting corporations to help them find the tools and people. We've found out that the wonders of the intelligence of local people can be transformed by the culture and the economy of this community, just by touching the passion, energy and imagination of the people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be Alice's miracles.
The Penn State University asked me -- a Ph.D. for communications -- to connect courses in communication.
I was scared.
I mean, fear. Fear from these students with their large brains and their big books and their big books, I don't know what to do.
But when the conversation came to work, he used to take me like Alice when she took her down to the pighole and saw a door to a new world.
I just felt like I was doing conversations with the students, and I was amazed by the idea they had, and I wanted others to find this miracle country.
I think in order to open up these towers, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy and environment, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go on. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-cient scientist.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, we're all embarrassed.
I want to show you a couple of the approaches that you can do, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well, what?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only do you think about your grandchildren, but also tell us that their phrores, the fatty structure in our bones, are examined because it's important to understand and treat osteoposis.
And if you describe what you do, then you'll have no-tested dictionary.
The dictionary words are a barrier to understanding your mind.
I think you could use "talk" and "time" in a while, but why don't you just tell the space and time," what's much more understandable for us?
To make your mind understandable is not the same as you're going to go down to the level.
As Einstein said, "Take things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific field without dealing with compromise.
Some things are thought about this: examples, stories and analogies. That way, you can get us into your betes.
And when you present your work, you'll take away the dots.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "something?"
What happens when someone else comes to mind? Another one is getting stabbed, and with these dots, you know, you're going to get your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits too much on the conversation-making part of our brain, and we're quickly challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the pigmentation is so stabilized that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, simplified sentence where the audience can lose the thread once it loses, reinterpreter the images and graphs that also inform our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open up the door and see the wonders of the science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the "Nerdin in me" -- I want to sum up everything with a equation.
Now, if you look at your science and your textbooks and you're talking, you're going to share them through the relevance, and so the audience says what's important, and multiply the passion that you have for your incredible work, and you're going to get some un-focused interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really sorry about it.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can tweet a message with a cell phone, and you can start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can upload it on sound cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Time 1984, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to change the road and demonstrated.
We're in 1989, and we're wondering that all these people who have come and asked change had cell phones in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everyone has a cell phone today.
But today, my cell phone wants to talk about me and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about.
This is 35.830 points of information.
We have raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.R. Rauway has set up a policy.
That policy line is the rule of law enforcement protection.
This rule is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service provider in the entire country, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls who? Who is sending an email?
Who is sending a text message to who they're sending?
And if you use a cell phone where you're.
All this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are all up and they said, "We don't want that."
They said, we don't want to have this reserve protection protection.
We want self-determinism in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of them said, "We don't want that."
And you can see tens of thousands of people pouring out on the streets of Berlin, and they said, "Sunity instead of fear."
And some of them even said that this could be a Bya 2.0.
The mask was the Creleck police department in eastern Germany.
And I also wonder if this really works.
Can we really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Declimate Telecom company that was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, let me give all the information you've stored over me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again and I couldn't get a right answer. Only another blue.
But then I told myself, I want to have this information, because it's my life that you're doing the dishes.
So I decided to put a court test on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was a comparison with them.
I'm going to take the message back to what they demanded me all.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court decided that the introduction of the E.U. was a legal response to German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD, this was what happened.
35.830 points of information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My way.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do to start with this?
Because you see where I'm where I'm asleep, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is the protection of protection.
So with time online and open data city, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and forth.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to K<unk>2. And how many calls I'm going to go.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about all of us.
First of all, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then I call myself a few friends, and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call you, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what makes society.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a design map for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who's talking to who's sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said earlier, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins had had cell phones in the fall in 1989,
And the beps knew who was in the demonstration, and if the St.C. had known to who the leader had been, it might never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall, perhaps it wouldn't have happened.
And then, not the case of the Iron Hemisphere.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get over us, online and online.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all long.
But self-determin and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So when you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your neighbors, just because companies and state countries have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to struggle with your own ego in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: domestic stores, rapid restaurants, brinkles.
So the city planners come together and they thought about changing the name of South Central to make it happen for something else, and they changed it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Strigent shops, rapid restaurants, bureaucratic spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive Canus and the Drivebys.
The comet is that the Drivehrus kill more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in unconditional diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it was about Beverly Hills, which is about 10 miles away.
I couldn't get that out.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of your house, the negative effects that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I'm thinking that the drivemill was bought and sold as a vehicle.
I see comedhing centers rolling around like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
I didn't feel like I'd had too much attention to 45 minutes of travel to get an apple that's not labeled with pesticides.
So I plant a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call parking lots.
It's 45 feet in diameter.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay there."
And I decided to keep it in the state.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grass, together, and we started planting my food whale, and fruit trees, and so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of executive group, together from gardening from all the social layers and from all the city, it's completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else complained.
The city came to me, and he basically put me on a plane, and said I have to get rid of my garden, and I've got to get the charge to a seduction configuration.
And I thought, "Okay, come on, right?
A seduction of food for growing food fires on a piece of land that you're completely not sure?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herself with this."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from this. Steve Lopez did a story about it, and I talked to the city, and I had a member of Green Ground Zero. They signed a petition on the front page.org and 900 signatures, we succeeded.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My town council even called, and said, "You know, they're supporting it and they love what we're doing."
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most parall in the United States in the possession of the city.
They have 4,500 miles of concrete.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should they not find it okay?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my Heaventy. I'm telling people to grow their own food.
To expand their own food is like printing your own money.
See, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more excited to be part of this preconceived reality made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
Homework is my graffiti. I'm harvesting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's filled with the walls, I'm going to make lawns and park systems.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my graft for this stuff.
You would be surprised what the ground Earth can do when you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden to become an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
You would wonder how children are influenced by this.
The garden is the therapeutic and most bold act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you get strawberry.
I remember when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 in the night. They were in my garden, and I came out and I looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not for all the rest of the road."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and it just empowered me to do this. People asked me, "You're afraid you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "Sum devil, no, I'm not afraid they're going to make it wrong.
It's the road.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take your health back."
At another time, I put a garden in this homeless garden in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it was just for a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people coming up with our way to the outside accounts, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat charcoal.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get any of it, if they don't get to show how they're influenced by food and body, they're blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids that are right on the path that they're looking for, and they're not going to run anywhere.
I see the gardens as an opportunity to train these children to care for their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could bring George Washington Carver the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipping container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The comet of sustainability is that you have to keep it through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and letting them enjoy the pride and honor and honor when you build their own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want you to become all environmental rebel, gangsters, gang gardeners.
We have to turn the picture of the sq.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You know, you're going to get a little bit of a crunch, yeah?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me if you sit in the web and want to make a meeting where you're talking about making any shit.
If you want to meet me, come with your knees, in my backyard, so that we can plant some shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "snollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "the non-profit politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper accounter gave a better definition: "A snolly monaster is someone who's waiting for a foreign, independent of party, program or program, and its success, and will achieve its success by the pure power of the monumental effect.
I have no idea what the manual is.
I think about it, in words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
For example, 1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers were not allowed to wipe out the exact word of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was looking at the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it to him, but he was courageous enough, he was brave enough to pursue, and he ended up having so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the sentence "so" as well as Brass." Many people think.
And then they're kind of like, you know, they're going to be on the English word for the tin.
But that's not true. It's all coming back to a promotion of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to America at the time that it's just achieved independence.
You could think about the question of how to call George Washington, the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a legal nation?
and it was discussed in Congress for an infinite amount of time.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-city George Washington, and others, the free of the people in the United States of America.
Not that special.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was safe.
They weren't monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with it, because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the journal of a Senate that constantly wrote, "Once the same topic."
The reason for the tickling, and the boredom was that the representation of the house was against the Senate.
The representative house wasn't going to make Washington a good thing. They didn't want it.
King calls it, and maybe even gives it to ideas about its outcomes.
They wanted to give him the most humble, the most miserable, horrifying title that they could think of.
This title was "Pictor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He happened before. But he just meant someone was performing a meeting.
It's something like the preference of a jury.
He had no longer bigger than the award "talk" or "pun water."
Sometimes there were a couple of second-dominated civil society and government groups, but it was really a non-numbered title.
That's why the Senate refused it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it to President.
This guy has to sign and hit foreign carriers.
Who's going to take him seriously when he's got a stupid little title like President of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, you were a little bit of a sense of the word "sor" as a "the" is about its own, but they wanted to make sure that they didn't agree with their honest respect for the opinions and the methods of civic nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, that it's the art of the state of the state of the state of Honor, it doesn't take respect to the president, and the United States.
You can learn three interesting things from this.
First, and I think that's the best -- but I couldn't figure out if the Senate ever reported the name of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, was just awarding the title. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
The second thing you can learn is that when a government says that something is temporary -- you're waiting 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, and that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is not as humbling, right?
It has to do with something more than 5,000 nucleic fishing bills that it has and the largest economy in the world and a flap of drones and all that stuff.
And reality and story have given the title of size.
And so the Senate ended up winning.
They've got a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the out of being of being religious -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear bombers and so forth.
So at the end of the day, the Senate won and lost the representment house because nobody feels humble when you're told you're the president of America now.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'm going to leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you very much.
So I went to a truck with about 50 rebellion at the fight for Moalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to wipe my black Converse semi-pounded gloves against a pair of brown leatheres and a rocket towards the government hospital that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been big before the war, but I've had been on the side of Pyjama party and football games and braking with racist Southeasts and heroist demonstrations that never had a "No one with communism and live and live in Afghanistan and I've been commuting and scrambling books before I knew what that meant.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, a more inspired Afghans, Southeast of God Gaden, an atheist, and a radical political artist who has been working for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So, there's a lot of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like painting rainglows. I want to make art that's connecting the personality and informing authority and re-visioning reality and even using a kind of imaginative human being to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- a story that governs its jihad against communityists like "Pop Starting" and used armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihadiest thing when the parliamenthip is to go for and do a choice campaign with the slogan, "Do I hire me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to break this vfiosi that's used as a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "reach the Rejection," where you give a police call, you know, you build a false control center on the streets of Kabul, and you keep cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money and giving them money to the name of the police department in Kabul, and they're hoping to give us 100 dollars.
I want to look at what happened in Afghanistan, I think, was the Intermodest conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with it have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture using a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine the Frink of Afghan dress with a protective or multiple korkworks into a moderate and a localized and a localized state.
And I'd like to see what a simple flap of Kabul looks like in the Kiplello of 1899 to create a dialogue about how we now develop development organization to have its roots in the past-day Colombian rhetoric about the White Shack to protect the brown man themselves and even a little bit of preservation.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, misrepresented.
But I do, because I have to, because the geography of self requires it.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I've been a model.
For 10 years, it was just said.
I feel like this is now building a very uncomfortable tension in the room, because I shouldn't have dress this dress.
Fortunately, I have something else to change.
This is the first time someone is going to join the TED stage, so you can appreciate being happy to see this.
If a few women were really excited when I came out, you don't need to tell me that I'll read that later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think of me.
And it's not everybody who has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to throw me off, so you don't do anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was certainly not as embarrassing as this picture.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend's friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to put my back and put my hand into this guy's hair.
And apart from surgery or the wrong brinkings I took for two days ago, there are very few ways to change our utterness, and our utterance -- although it's superficial and irreversible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and I'm calling this a sexy girl in my industry.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but I'm going to answer the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a prize in the genetic lottery, and a critical legacy, and you might wonder what that legacy is.
Now, in the last few decades, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, where we are biologically programmed, but as big, sliff, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that was paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashioners might be calling, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu."
And first, I'm commenting your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has counted all the modules on the sidewalks, each single one that was being dased, and that from 677 square-tasking only 27 or less than four percent of them were not aware.
The next question I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model when I'm grown?"
And first I say, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of America, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-brain surgeon, which would be completely wrong, because then you're the first one."
If they still say after this great category, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who am my boss."
Because I don't have responsibility for nothing, and you could be the president of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to become a model later, it's like saying that you want to get the Jacket in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of digitized model knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be unfolding.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is just like a nice beam there, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to take a picture of it," now the leg first goes up, and long, and long, this arm goes back, this arm, this head is on the front of three-quarters, and you just move back and just look back and see your little, 400 friends, 400 minutes.
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and you have a lifewalk and you've done a few jobs, you can't tell much more. If you say you want to be president of the United States, but you're in the room, "10 years of intermedital bags," you're looking at weird.
The next question I'm often asked is, "Who are you raising all the photos?"
And yes, pretty much all the photos are stored, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was the very first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my time back.
I know that's going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is how I saw just a few months ago with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this movie.
My friend had to get me around.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a magazine party for French birdgy.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll see that these images are not images of me.
They're constructs, and they're building a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and remixers and photographers and Stylists and all their fellow pilots and their posts and post-program production. They're not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Well, did you mean, do you mean, do you do anything for free?"
Yeah, I have too many 20-foot-tinted gloves that I can never wear, except, but the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
As a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was walking over a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took me a "Excuse me, Mr. Ww. Kingers," and we could go on.
I've got these free things about my appearance, and I don't have people with my personality, and I don't have a lot of them who look and don't pay for their personality.
I live in New York, and I live from 140,000 teenagers who have been shot and shot in the last year, and we were 85 percent black and Latino and mostly young men.
It's only 177,000 young and white black and Latino, and it doesn't matter to say, "Am I stopped?"
It was, "How many times am I stopped? When am I stopped?"
And I found out, in my research, that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent when they got 17 percent.
The last question I'm asking myself is, "What is it that it's like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer to, "If you're a little bit thinner and you have gluteny hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backups, we'll give a answer that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's just half the story, because what we never say before the camera is what I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsafe."
And I feel unsafe because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you've ever wondered, "Would I have happier if I had thin legs and gliny hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most beautiful hair and the most coolest puppets, and they're because of their appearance of their most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very hard to get me to a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable with getting me there and say, "I got all the benefits that were being put into my own place," and it also doesn't feel very good for me to say, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was very difficult to unite a legacy of oppression for gender and race when I'm one of the biggest supplementers.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done this, before 10 or 30 years, and my career has gone, because I wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or I wouldn't tell you how I would not tell you about college, which is so important.
If you take something out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misinterpreted success and misfort.
Thank you.
I never forgot about the words of my grandmother that came to life in exile: "Son, paddafi resistance. Get him.
But never become something like a Gaddafi revolution."
There have been nearly two years since the Namibian revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass mass mass mass extinders and both in the Egyptian revolution.
I was connecting with many other Libyes, inside and outside, to challenge a day of anger, and to start a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Young, licensed women and men in the first row, they asked the end of the regime, and they held Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice into the air.
They have demonstrated exemplified courage by providing against the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity from the far east to the far east, to the south.
After the end of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we were able to free our country and reduce the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a great servant, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the basis of the trajectory.
Over the course of four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannic regime has destroyed both infrastructure, and also the moral structure of the lybic society.
I realized the devastation and the challenges, as so many other women, I rented to rebuild the civil society of Lyias, and we asked for a regulated and unite transition to democracy and national justice.
Near to 200 organizations, while they were born and immediately after Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I went back to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started working workshops to organize human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Liby Women, a movement of women, leadership from various different forms of life, whose goal is to be public for the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and to our right for the right for the rational and for democracy.
I met in a very difficult environment where I found myself in a very difficult environment, a environment that was vastly polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I led an initiative to fund sanitation platform of Liby women to achieve a judicial rule, a law that any citizen, no matter what to do with the background, to vote for and to run for the right and to address primarily for political parties between male and female and female candidates at the vertical level and end up making a constant and un-pilling score.
At the end, our initiative was taken and succeeded.
Women won 175 percent of the national debate in the first elections since 52 years.
But it was, in fact, the history of elections and the whole revolution, because every day we started making new news messages about violence.
We went to the prison party for the dawn of ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
On the other morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack.
And then, again, another morning, the wounded were signed by the army.
And we're really much every day with the laws of militias and their ongoing success against the human rights prisoners and their neglect of rules and laws.
Our society is shaped by a revolutionary state of mind, polarized, and distant from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they were at the beginning.
Intuse, decency, revenge became the icon of the <unk>the<unk>an<unk>s Sourgence of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our pressing list and the elections.
In fact, I'm here to confuse that we, as a nation, have made false choice and false decisions.
We've put our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or safety in Lybias.
Did the hard-to-course and the change between women and male candidates led peace and national reconciliation?
No, it didn't.
What is it then?
Why is it that our society is going to continue to polarize and dominate politically and the purpose of both men and women and women?
Maybe the women weren't the only thing that was missing, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the one who was.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus gap as it needed to have elections that only has strengthening polarization and degradation.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting on the name of anger and ask a day to fight the revenge.
We need to start acting on behalf of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just claim the next values, but it also raises the problem: that instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, rather than execution.
These are the ideals that need to be fought by war, and they're desperately designed to get peace.
Because peace has an alchemy, and in this alchemy, it's about the relocation of feminine and masks.
That's the real punch.
And we have to do this in general before we do it socio-centimal.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam" -- "Love the word of the Good God, cumbling."
The word "raheem" again, which is well known in all the abangled traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rahem" and symbolizes the maternal feminine, all of humanity, all around the manhood and the female, all of the tribes and all the tribes have gone.
And just like the mother's abdomen growing in his embryo, it's going to be the basic of compassion all the way.
And so we said, "My Gnade is all about things."
And so I was told, "My Gnade has been pre-fosted in front of my Groll."
Let's all be the space of the GINS.
Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought, my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing" in a way.
And I was very proud.
In school, we were pushing the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a whole changing time.
At seven years, I saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from a colleague of mine to a colleague's sister.
And he said, "If you're going to do this, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore, because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're dying soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly after that, I went through the railroad station and saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A Saudi woman was lying on the ground, and a her mother was crushed in her arm, in a lightly helpless way, his mother's face.
But no one helped them because they were all so busy to care for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'90s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were dying of famine, and many more people were only surviving because they ate grass, beetles and tree cortex.
So electricity wastes have become more and more and more so that at night, it's all that I've been so much more aged to the lights of China on the other side of the fish that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors on night.
This is the river of the ampard, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very, very much of its way, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of them die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can tell you that I was sent to the devastating years of famine to China.
I just thought I would be separated for a while of my family.
I never thought it would take me 14 years to work together.
In China, it was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I didn't have any idea of what life would be like as a North Korean refugee refugee, but I soon learned that it's not only very difficult, but it's very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in silence that my real identity could fly through, and you would send me back to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was when I was caught by the Chinese police police officer and sent to the police department.
Somebody was accused of being Northan female, so they tested my Chinese records and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid of this, and I thought I would explode my heart.
If anything is unnatural, I could be locked and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the surveys, a officer said to the other, "That was a false mess.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China have reports in foreign messages called Ayl, but many are caught by the Chinese police police.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they got caught, they eventually released out of massive international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much fortune.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are rejected to North Korea, where they are tortured, imprisoned or publicly owned.
Although I was lucky enough to escape, many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle hard for their survival.
And once they've learned a new language and they've found work, their world can be put on their heads in a moment.
And after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life again.
I was leaving South Korea, and I was a bigger challenge than I thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I've also noticed the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've become very different from ourselves, because of 67 years of division.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northananan?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the adaptation to the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show at university.
Just as I became more and more of my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities started the money I was sending my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to be moved to a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as quickly as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go through an incredible route on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself go to the northwest border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run it for more than 2,000 miles from China and then South Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed, and told him they were mumfum, and I was her lock.
He looked at me in a mad, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get it all the way to the moderate border, but I had to use almost all my money to get the border control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and paid money, my family was released in a month, but shortly, my family was replicated again, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to protect my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the Southern Embassy.
I went and I went from the immigration agency and the police department, and I tried desperately to let my family go, but I didn't have enough money to pay back and pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And then I asked the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised that a stranger was looking for it.
I was talking to my career in silence, and I was telling my situation, and I wasn't going to go to a bank machine, and I was paying the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get it out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger have symbolicized me for a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope-maans that need the North Koreans.
After all, after our long journey, my family and I were back in South Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, the professional education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family resources, and we're sending them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would like to make hope to succeed in Northern Koreans with international assistance.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I'm just going to have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce my brothers to you now.
Remi is 22, big, very good.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He's not sharing them, and he's not sharing them inappropriate.
He's not stupid. He doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to think about words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he was stolen my chocolate cater, but he remembers every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while he was the first episode of the teapbies on my arm and he was carrying G Lady's birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But a lot of people don't vote.
And in fact, because their minds are not in the social version of normal, they're often over and wrong.
But what motivates my heart and my soul was that, although that was the case, although they were not seen as usual, that only one could mean they were extraordinary -- autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compendedism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a different way of looking at each individual, and that's why Remi is so different from Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes in a new person is noticed autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing interventions in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm sitting in autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very much.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me.
Remi lived and reigned in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, putting the washing machine and eating everything that came under it.
And when he grew older, he became different and the differences became visible.
But behind the anger and the frust and the hidden hyperactivity, something really unique: just a non-violent and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had ever been lied.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were a few challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normalality is the beauty that gives us differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it. And all of us, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has filled us with awe and curiosity with this photo on a project that has a apple, and with a mass-time period of only a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're faster, and we're not seeing the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femtoto photography, a new engineering technique that's so fast that they can create rapid-speed video images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that are beyond our perspective to look out corners or without an <unk>-ray image in our bodies and really ask what we mean with my camera.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I take it in a billionth of a second and out of it -- these are several-seconds -- I'm going to make a package of photons that is barely a millimeter, and this photon pack, this project, is going to move into light speed, and it's like, you know, a million times faster than a second project.
So, if you take this project, take this photon pack and put it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So, this whole event.
So, remember, the whole event actually takes less than a nanotore -- so long, the light takes to get back to that lane -- but I'm trying to make this video more than 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So, this film is going on a lot, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, is going into the bottle with a photon stack that starts to move through and then bursts inside.
Part of the light is flowing outwards outside the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the flow of the bottle and explode into different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that's coming around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflections are focused on some of the ends of the bottle after a few images.
Now, if you take a common project and you take it back to the same route and you slow it back to the order of 10 billion, you know, how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project to move.
And what about a little still-time photography?
You can see how these waves are going to be, again, the corner of the table, the Tomate and the wall is flashing over the back.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed to me as if nature was painting this picture, each one of the things that we see, but of course our eye is a stacked picture.
But if you look at these Tom'sssss, you'll see that if the light is rolling around the Tomate, they're going to keep going. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is coming up and the light jumps around in her and comes back to a few billionth of a second.
So, in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you could go into a supermarket and find out if a fruit is closed without touching it.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with short air time, you have very little light, but we're going to put a billion times faster than your shortest calvity time, so you're not getting as good as light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photo pack, a million times, and we're drawing it back with very clever synchronizing, and we're going to combine these gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superhero: to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to cool light on the door.
It's going to be interrupted, and it's going to go into space, and part of it's going to bounce back to the door, and eventually we could use that extrapolatory light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall, there's a puppet hidden, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the International Communications Service, it was taken out of Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to cut this light project, and they're going to wake up on this wall, and this photon pack is going to spread all the way, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will then let the light back into the back, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but they'll get very, very, very, very, very, very
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is that we're hearing about.
By making a laser light, we can take a raw image that -- as you can see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but then when we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and we put them together and try to analyze the various light courses, can we see the object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a lot of stuff to do before we can do this in the laboratory in practice, we could build cars that will avoid collisions and recognize what's on the curve, or we can search for endangered adults to look at light that's reflected through open windows, or we can build endcopes around the body around Okacko and also look at the powder.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's very challenging, which is why this is really a web call for scientists to think about Femto imaging, because a new model of technology could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edapon, a few seconds, even a scientist, science has become an art, a modern art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we're collecting every time we're using, not just the scientific visual processing. We can also create a new form of computer photography, and we can only look at the wave between those times. We can't look at all of those things about looking at the wave of time
But it's also a bit fun.
If you look at these waves under the tube, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move around us.
What's going on here?
And it turns out that we're almost as we've ever seen in light speed, we've got weird effects, and Einstein would love to see this picture.
The order of events in the world will appear in the video in reverse order, so by applying the context of space and time, we can correct these biases.
So whether or not you focus around photography or create new imaging offers for medicine or new forms since our invention has opened up all the data and detail on our website, and hope that the Fasterers and the creative community will show us that we should stop taking the megapels and the next to the next few dimensions -- to start to start to take the next and to the next one, and to start the next few dimensions -- and to start on the next, and to get the next few
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives in our societies.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street so many conversations don't get passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the last few years, and use things like stickers and spoons and chalks.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is fills from the giant oak that had been adorable for hundreds of years, drunk and shours of shade. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time anyone never ever never sees, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the most abandoned parts in America.
I live around this house, and I thought about how I can make it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it brought me a sense of the things that I've been interested in now.
But it's hard to keep me alive with this view of day.
It's easy to lose your life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I transformed a side of the house into a giant blackboard, and I wrote it with a wall of the gaps: "Before I'm going to die, I want to give you ... anybody who can come back, take a piece of chalk, and think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was filled and she grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to stand on the latest line."
"I'm going to die before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm going to die before I die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm going to die." I want to live on web-friendly."
"I'm going to die before, I want to keep them in my arms once."
"I'm going to die before, I want to be a person's cavicry."
"I'm going to die before I die, I want to be all myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to cry and moke me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's in a new and appropriate way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I've done this last year, and I've received hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a kit, and now in the world, in places like Kazazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power our public spaces have when we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right and think about life being short and sensitive.
We're often stopped talking about death or thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation to death is one of the things that strengthen us.
The idea of death illustrates our lives.
Our common spaces are best for us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and our fears and stories, people around us can't just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm looking for math. I'm involved in a very special problem for anyone who's been involved in this approach to math, is that we're like business workers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I'm doing today.
Teaching is one of the most human activities.
We're thrilled to see the most glorious ballet and teammers as you'll see.
Now, for ballet, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a basic element that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It also makes it to my Kenyan rituals that he was a ballet deal.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet, in the world, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the irreversible symptoms like weaknesses, tremor, and others who live more, and that's why we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress objective, and ultimately the only way to know if there is a cure when we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
In trouble, there's no biomarkability for Parkinson's disease and other other brain disorders, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that we have here is this 20-minute test with neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials will never be done. Never before.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a corporate hospital.
It costs 300 percent to actually investigate in the neurological domain.
So I want to suggest to you a unconventional method that we're trying to do this, because we're all, in a sense, virtuous like my Iranian grappels.
So here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles that you see.
This is what happens in a healthy state, when someone is making a speech character, and we can look at it as a coherent ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs if we make the sounds, and we all have the genes for it.com2, for example.
And how ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until they're speaking.
And by the sound, we can determine the position of the vibrating mood waves, and as the limb is also affected by Parkinson's vocal muscles.
On the bottom record, you can see an example of irregular vocal resonance tricks.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Trueness, weakness, sininess.
The language is going to be even more wis and nourged, and that's an example of theymptom.
And these impacts can be minimally, sometimes with digital microphones and precision processing software combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now tell where someone lies in a mixture of disease and health, because of the vocal muscles.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test is in neurologists.
Not so much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are accurate. For that, the rules are not done by experts.
So they can be done by their own.
They're very fast, they're at the maximum level of 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a high scale.
So these amazing goals we can do with this.
We can reduce logistics difficulty in patients.
Patients don't have to perform routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through the current observation.
We can do low-cost massage approaches for clinical trials, and we can first get the study of the whole population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this path, we're going to start the Parkinson's health organization.
With Aculab and patient TikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voices all over the world to have enough seed data for the ability to get these targets.
We have GPS numbers that are available to three-quarters of a billion people on the planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease can call it cheap to leave images for a few cents. I'm very familiar with joy that we've reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from it, say, we're going to take 10,000 people, and then you can tell who's healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to sign in the call, if this person has Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you may not get it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, in various circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are to type these into order to figure out which markers are for Parkinson's.
At the same time, you have 86 percent accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done so fantastic work -- has shown that it's also working on the cell phone network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a better improvement.
That means people can -- people can call with the phone and do the test. People could call it to Parkinson's phone, they could send their voice to check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the back, you see the cows of my father, and that's behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the South, and that means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night, and I woke up in the morning and found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buump.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we could come together with our animals and the openland of the sky, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I used to hate lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our rodents. They're also brought to this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park there's only so few lions.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years for his father's cows. That's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Bears feared from fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but to help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't get on. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried it with a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to be next to the cow's Day.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird birds and go back, but the next time, they come and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they take off and they kill our livestock.
One night, I was watching the crucion. I was walking around with a slap in my hand, and this time the lions didn't get.
Bears fear light, which moves.
I had an idea.
I've been working all day in my room, and I've even taken the new radio from my mother, and I'd almost put it around the day. But I'd learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a driver of a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I got a switch to turn the lights off and off.
This is a little phole from a broken pockets.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is integrating the battery, it's providing electricity to the right-player. I call it a transformer.
And the driver's safety is blinking.
You can see that the ellles are pointing out, because they come from there.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights glow and the lions believe I'm walking around the rubble. And I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our homes, and since then, we haven't had the problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really working well.
My idea is now used all over Kenya, including for other predators like hymen or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved and helping with fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we put the lights where there's no other, and I'm showing people how to use them.
I was just a boy who was a boy who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was crying cows. I saw airplanes over me and said, "You know, I'm going to sit in one day!"
And here I am.
I was invited to get a plane to work for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to become a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to hunt lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father, and we can put the lions together, and we can live side with the lions without arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got this scholarship now. Yeah.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's next on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. A electrode fence?
Yeah, I know, electric fences have been invented long, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it once, right -- yeah, I've tried it a little while, but I've given it back because I got a blow.
All the way. Richard Turder, you're a bit weird.
We're going to hire you every step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and I didn't have one of them.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting was thought of.
To be honest, most of them were shot from random tour tour tourists.
My story starts when I was a speech in New York, and my wife made this picture, where I held my daughter's first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57st and five.
And so, one year later, we went back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this goes from ...
When my daughter's third birthday came up and said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do it a father-daughter race to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking the new tourists to do a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a whole stranger to take his camera.
Nobody said no, and fortunately nobody is still sitting with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travelers would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened that day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a given moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us to keep time in October a week and how we change our time and how we're coming from year, not just physically but in everything.
Because while we're always making the same picture, our perspective changes as we can see, as they're reaching new milelones, I can see the life with their eyes as they deal with everything and how it sees.
And this very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value, and we expect to wait for every year.
And in fact, while one of our travels, we walked around and suddenly they were standing like this, and it's actually showing up on a red bar on a dollboard that they had learned as a little child in the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years at the exact same point.
She said she remembers her heart of her shoulder when she saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks in New York schools because she's really going to go to New York.
And I realized that it was obvious. The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like in you, but besides those 15 images, I'm not on a family photo.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
I want to encourage all of you today to come to the image and not ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
BLEU = 26.78, 57.7/34.2/21.8/14.1 (BP=0.961, ration=0.962)
