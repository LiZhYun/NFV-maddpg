When I was 11, I was hit by the sounds of a day of a handful of little joy.
My father heard the news show on his little, gray radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was kind of unusual at the time, because the news was often depressed.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned to go to school.
And so I was paying for five years as a boy, and I was advising my older sister who couldn't get himself to a secret school.
And so we could go both to school.
Every day, we took another way so that no one could guess where we went.
We're hidden in our books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just going to buy a grocery store.
We were put under a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was a stiffle in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then again, the class had to be noticed for a week because the Taliban had been spotted.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Did they challenge us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we were still trying to go to school.
I was very lucky enough to grow up in a family where education was as important and valued and my daughters.
My grandfather was ahead of his day.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanistan. He insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
But my mother was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retire, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family who had ever received an education.
He was always aware that his kids would receive an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He looked at it as a much greater risk of sending his kids not to school.
I know, even though I was so frustrated in the Taliban, I was so frustrated by our lives, by the quiet fear and the interrelation of the perspective.
I was having good lust to give up, but my dad said, "Told, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can get stolen. You can be distributed from your house in war.
But one thing is, you're going to stay in there. And even if we have to pay our blood for your school sales, we're going to do that.
So -- do you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have a higher degree of college graduation, and if my family hadn't been so much used for my education, I would also have one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudant, a Jew of the Midbury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first to congratulate me.
It doesn't just hide with my graduate degree, but it also makes me the first woman and I'm the one driving him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've been able to start FIOLA, the first and perhaps the only board of school girls, a country where girls' school workers are still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students at my school want to sense all of their more ambitious opportunities.
And seeing her parents and fathers standing for her, as my parents were doing, despite the after and against all the deemed events.
Like Ahmed. This is not a real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter was his daughter, and he was walking home from SOLA to her village, and they're the death of a bomb on the side of the road just for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang, and a voice beat him if he was sending his daughter back to school, they would try again.
He said, "Take me now if you want to, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your old and over-expived imagination."
In Afghanistan, I've found something that is often being rejected in the West: behind most of us who have succeeded, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that is aware that their success is also its success.
It's not to say that our mothers are not going to be important in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones who are once more tolerant and persuasive and persuasive in the future of their daughters, but in a society like the ones in Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And under the Taliban, there were only a few hundred girls who went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to look at America, and it seems like this.
Americans recognize how unsafe these changes are.
I'm afraid that changes are not long-term, and they're not changing with the people's residing across the U.S. troops.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them for their support, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me of hope and unregulated opportunities, and it reminds me every day the girls who visit the SOLA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, also for a living -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not -- -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia working on the engineering world with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs, we failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years, we were a brilliant person, and we made good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples To Zambezi," was one of the things we wanted to show in Italy to the people of Sambias to be the production of food.
We came to the Sahara with Italian seed seeds, and we got to this water, which leads to Sambesi River, and we trained to train the local population of the local, the European tomato and tocini, and --
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they also came up.
We were amazed that there was no agricultural agriculture in such a fertile valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank goodness we're here!"
"Make still in time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderfully expressed in Africa.
We had this gorgeous tomato tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the guests, "Look, how simple agriculture is?"
When the tomato tires were spinning and red, over the night, there were about 200 neners from the river and they were all yelling out.
We said to the Himalayan tsunami, "Oh God, the Fourber!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have farming here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so brilliant in Africa, but then I saw what Americans were doing, what the English world was doing, what I saw, after I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the pier.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've given to the unrestable African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a South-American economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We have given the African continent to 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been doing.
Just listen to her book.
Reading from an African man, which we've been doing.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionals, and there are only two ways that we deal with people, and we locate them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "fater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchical: I treat every other culture, like they're my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronisung: I treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
So, these are white people in Africa called "bhen," the boss.
I was bitterly embarrassed when I read the book "Small Beautiful" by shirts. He said, in terms of economic development, if people don't want help, they leave them alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference opened, took a pole on the floor, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolatial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and I invented a system called business promotion, where no one was ever initiated, no one is ever motivated, but you're going to be motivated to be the local passion director, the servant of local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you keep your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put them together with the local locals.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in kitchipens.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friendhood, we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like the thing, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
I had this case a lot of years ago: Why, instead of getting into a community and saying to people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
Entrepreneurs never have a part, and they will never say in public what they want to do with their money, what they can see for opportunities.
Design has this light-sensitive position.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be public meetings.
We work to do one to do that, to make it, we have to be made a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It has to be a new job.
This is the hospital company's hospital, the hospital worker who sits with you in the house, on your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the tools to transform your passion in a way to move life.
I tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was doing the time, trying to escape the disarming flaws, where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking around the streets for the first year, and I had my first three days of customers, and I helped him. He was making fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell him to a restaurant in Perth, and he would come to organize the fishermen, and they would say, "You've helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishermen work together and I didn't have these amazing tuna selling a factory in Albany for 60 cents a million cents, but to Japan for sushi for Sushi for 15 dollars. And then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects in one year, and the government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I keep the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Let's get it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 50,000 companies in the design of this project.
There's a new generation of companies that are coming to loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was looking at companies. Peter's printer said, planning is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty force.
So you build Christchurch without knowing what the smartest man Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to a person.
You have to offer them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get a lot of them.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What presentation do you most cheated for tomorrow?
<unk>"Song, passionate people. You hated this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- we have the calculated fossil fuels, the manufacturing capacity -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open species of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, to be able to channel, to transport, to exchange them.
The technologies don't exist for that.
Who is going to invent this technology for green revolution? Do universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
It will be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York in 1860s.
In 180, they came together and they were clameling, which would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was an unification: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows in the speed of the speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get the crap off six million horses.
Because they were already lying in the dung.
In 180, they see the dirty technology that makes life warm from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive maker in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology had made the race. There were little factories in the backyard.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered discretionion.
They don't come to talk to you.
Next thing you have to offer them absolute, dedicated and passionate services.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, everybody has to be able to perform three things: to sell that product, to be great, to be a market market market force, and to be enormous.
Do you guess?
We've never met a single person who can also produce something, sell and take care of money.
It doesn't exist like that.
This person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have all been called to be leaders, only one thing that has been founded by one person.
Now we're teaching 16 years of Southeast entrepreneurship, and we're beginning to give them the lectures to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Autographs, and the job of the 16 years old, it's to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons of Autography, how often he uses the word "the" and how many times the word "we" is."
Never "I" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he began.
Nobody founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitator has a small professional background in cafes and bars and bars. Their dedicated buddy who will do for them, what someone here's a gentleman who's talking about this vigi. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting corporate facilitators to help them find the tools and people. We've found that the wonders of the intelligence of local populations can be transformed, that culture and the economy of this community can only be understood by touching the passion, energy and imagination of people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how to be in the world of Alice's miracles.
So Penn State University asked me to share a Ph.D. for communications -- to try to connect engineers into communications.
I was scared.
I'm afraid. Fear of those students with big brains and their big books and their big books, I don't know what they are.
But when the conversation started to work, it was like Alice, when she was going down to the pig's pig and saw a door to a completely new world.
And so I felt like I was doing conversations with the students, and I was amazed by the idea they had, and I wanted others to find this miracle.
I think in order to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We need some great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy, environment and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go on. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religist, looking for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come from when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, we're going to be embarrassed.
I want to show you a couple of attempts, how you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're looking at is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well, what?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only does you think of your cheeks as well, but also tells us that their feathers, the fluffy structure in our bones, are looking at it because it's important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you have preventable dictionary.
In other words, there's a barrier to understanding your thoughts.
I don't know if you could use "discovery" and "lapse" and "happy" in your hand, but why don't you just say "a-space and time," and time," what's much more comfortable for us?
To make your thoughts understand, it's not the same as your level of viewing down.
As Einstein said, "Take things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with compromise.
So a couple of things are thought about: examples, stories and analogies. So you can get us in your own way.
And if you present your work, you'll have the points away.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "something?"
What happens when someone gets to mind? Another one is getting stabbed, and with those dots you're looking at, you're going to have your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits too much on the conversation-making part of our brain, and it's very quickly been challenging.
This example of Genevieve Brown is a lot powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the spine is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simplified sentence where the audience can actually lose the thread, adjust the thread, adjust the images and graphs that also inform our other senses and make a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few attempts that can help us open up the door and see the wonders of the world that the science and the technology is coming in.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the "Nerdin" button in me, I'm going to put everything in a equation.
Now, if you look at your science and your preference and your diatures, they're sharing this through the relevance, so the audience is important, and they're multiplying the whole thing you've got with your incredible work: and it's coming up with incredible interfaces that are filled with new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really excited about it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can tweet a message with a cell phone, and you can start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can upload it on sound cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1904, and I live in Berlin.
So let's go back to that city at that time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people came to the streets and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're wondering that all these people who were asking and questioning changes had cell phones in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phone up, keep it up!
Hold it up. A Android, an Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about myself and my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
We have raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.F. has set up a policy.
This is a rule of law enforcement protection.
This line is that every business company in Europe has to store every Internet service agency in Europe, a range of users in the entire Europe.
Who calls who? Who is sending an email?
Who is sending a text message to whom?
And if you use a cell phone, where you're.
All this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people have stood up and said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this reserve protection protection.
We want to keep self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see tens of thousands of people wandering around the streets of Berlin saying, "Freedom instead of fear."
And some of them said, well, this could be a be a be something called the Isas 2.0.
The arena was the Treeimpol police in eastern Germany.
And I also wonder if this really works.
Can all of this information store over us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Declol commercial company, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please send me all the information you've lost.
And I asked her once, and she said, "I don't get a right answer. Only a rich blues.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that you're doing the dishes.
So I decided to put a court review on them, because I wanted to get this information.
But the German telecom said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was about one comparison with them.
I'm going to take the message back to what they're going to send to me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court of the attorney decided that the introduction of E.U. was a German law enforcement threat.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 lines of information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My back.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do?
Because you see where I am, where I'm asleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, "I want to go to the public with this information."
I want to get them published.
Because I want to show people what is the protection protection protection of these people.
So with time and open data and open data City, I've done this here.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and down.
You can track every step that I do. You can track.
And you can even see how I'm driving from Frankfurt with the train to K<unk>n, and how many calls I'm going to go.
All of this is possible by this information.
It's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then they call me some friends, and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call them up, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, what time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what makes society.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a map of countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who they're sending an email, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said earlier, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their bag.
And the Stasi would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders were, that might never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall, perhaps it wouldn't have happened.
And then, not the case of the icy curtain.
Because today's national agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get over us, online and online.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store all that well-time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is an issue of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your surrogate, just because companies and government places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information they've stored on.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight for your own self-centric ego.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: chain stores, rapid-riders, brkops.
So the city map is meeting, and they're thinking about changing the name of South Central, so it's for something else, and they're changing it in South Los Angeles, like this is something that changes something that goes wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Impordable stores, rapid-gole restaurants, bride flights.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive Canus and the Drivebys.
The great thing is that the Drive-thrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in unconditional diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't quite get that out.
And I wondered, if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of your house, you see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I realize that carriers buy and sold as a vehicle.
I see a dialogian color travel up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what it has to stop.
I understood that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I'd been paying a <unk>20,000 vacation to get an apple that's not labeled with pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a park park.
It's 45 feet in diameter.
The thing is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to stay."
And I decided to keep it in the same way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, and we started planting my food deforestation, and fruit trees, and so the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of executive group, composed of gardens from all the social layers and from all the city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came to me, and he basically assigned me a chain of a drive, and he said I have to remove my garden, the supply was an asset.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
A seductive set of calls for growing food on a piece of land that you're completely not comfortable with?
And I thought, "Cool. Her hand."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from this. Steve Lopez made a story and spoke to the city Council, and with a member of Green Ground Island, they signed a petition on Change.org, and we were successful with 900 signatures.
We stopped the victory in our hands.
My town even called it to me, and said they're supporting it and they're loving what we're doing.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most of the real estate in the United States in the property of the city.
They have 4,500 miles of bride.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should they not find that right?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my body of drones, I'm telling people to make their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm glad to be part of this preconceived reality made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Homework is my graffiti. I'm harvesting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's drawing the walls, I'm going to make lawns and plant equipment.
I use the garden, the earth, the one piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my valves for this stuff.
You would be surprised what the ground Earth can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my backyard as my garden became an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the soil.
You would wonder how kids are affected by this.
So the garden is the most therapeutic and sastest act that you can do, especially in the city.
And you can also get strawberry.
I remember when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a fundamental rule on the road."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and it just empowered me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you don't fear people being sold."
And I said, "Foresaw, no, I'm not afraid they're going to make it squeaks.
And it's also on the street.
So that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
And at another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it had changed, even if it was just a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had a look at our zabatata and we had 50 people doing it, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow coal, kids eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get any of those, if they didn't show how they affect food and bodies, they eat blindly whatever you're going to vote for.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that they're looking for, and they're not going to get anywhere.
I see the gardening as an opportunity to train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the soil floor, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipping container and convert it into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free stop, because free is not sustainable.
The great thing about sustainability is that you have to keep them through.
I'm talking about taking people's work and getting kids from the streets, and letting them experience the pride and honor when you build their own food, and when you open up farmers' markets.
So, what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want you to become all environmental rebel, gangster, gang-hangers.
We have to turn the picture of the void.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gangster.
You know, you're going to get a dog with a hug, you know?
And let that be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're going to sit in the box and you want to make a meeting where you're talking about making some shit.
If you want to meet me, you come with your shaft, you get in my backyard so that we can plant some shawnair.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nnnollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "snollygoster" means "is-free politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher gave birth to a better definition: "A snollygoster is someone who is willing to pursue an office, independent of party, program or performance, and his success is achieved by the pure power of the monumentalential hormone.
I have no idea what the manual is.
I think about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
In 1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers were not allowed to have the exact word of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was looking at the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave him a bold, he was brave enough, he was too brave enough, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the phrase "so stronger like Brass." Many people think.
Brasset is a word for the English Valley.
But that's not true. It's coming back to a demand for the press of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States, at the time that it has just reached independence.
You'd have a question of, like, "How do you call George Washington, the state of state?"
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a distinguished nation?
It was debated in Congress for infinitely long.
And there were all kinds of useless suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-city George Washington, and other people, and the regulation of the freedom of the people of America's United States of Washington.
Not that specific.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was preventable.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with a little bit of bored, because this debate was doing three weeks.
I read the diary book of a U.S. writer who was constantly writing, "I've been thinking about the same topic."
The reason for the delay and the boredom was that the live-class house was against the Senate.
The representative house wanted not to be able to make Washington a bullet. They didn't want to.
King calls, and maybe even gives him ideas to follow.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most daunting title that they thought they were.
This title was "The Guesentor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He had existed before. But he just meant someone was complaining.
It's something like the precursor to a jury.
He had no longer bigger size than the award "dssify" or "compassion."
Sometimes there were a couple of civilized leaders and government groups, but it was really a unremarked title.
And so the Senate refused to give it off.
They said, "It's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up the agreements and hit foreign winers.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of America's United States president?
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't respond.
Instead, it was meant to be the name of the book, not to use it, but they were absolutely conscious that they were not comfortable with their honest respect for the opinions and institutions of civilized nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, that the office of the state of the head is not necessarily respected -- and the president was not necessarily imposing the rest of the United Nations's concerning conviction of the United States.
You can learn three interesting things about this.
One is -- and I think that's best -- I couldn't figure out if the Senate has ever been officially the name of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has only hated the title. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something is temporary -- -- you're waiting for 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is not so humbling, right?
It has to do with something more than 5,000 nucleic sworders that he has and the greatest economy in the world and a fleet drone and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title of size.
And so the Senate ended up getting the seat.
They got a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the supposed of divinity -- well, it was like this.
But do you know how many nations have an president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the day, the Senate won and the representation house was lost because nobody feels humble when you're told you're the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away, and I'm going to leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came up in a truck with about 50 rustels at the fight for the jalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm listening to my black-in-wholid gloves against a pair of brown leatheres and a rocket that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time before, I had become a war with war, but I was a little bit of a good time with Pyjama party and a football game and aimship-and-the-world combat with the Dutch and the Sending-natural demonstrations that had never been to travel and live with Afghanistan and to look at the stories that I knew before that meant what was going on.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, a kind of, a grown-up, a woman named South African-world-states from God Ghrades. An atheist and a radically political artist who lived in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So there are lots of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rain tales. I want to make art that compares the personality and stimulate authority and re-vision the reality and actually using a kind of a kind of imaginative human-made experience to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- a guy who's doing jihad based on communityists like "Pop Star Bling" and uses armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihad judge when they're going to run for Parliament and they're going to make a choice campaign with the slogan, "Do I choose me! I'm rich."
And trying to use this campaign to break these mafiosi who are using as a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption of Afghanistan, with a project called "reemcession," where you give yourself a policeman, you build a false control center on the streets of Kabul, and you keep cars on the streets of Kabul, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money to the name of Kabul, and let them honor them, and you hope that they're going to take 100 dollars to take us.
I want to look at what was the conflict in Afghanistan, I think, in my own mind, becoming the Intermodical conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him, they created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture, by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I'm putting the Fridge from local Afghan dressers with a protective or multiple pits into a moderated and a moderated secularized secularized state.
And I'd like to see what a simple pusher looks like in Kabul, between Kiplings's app, from 1899 to create a dialogue about how the current development development organization has its roots in the past-down rhetoric of the White Beauty, to protect the brown man from himself and even a little bit of civilized.
But for all these things, you can get to jail, you can be misunderstood, you can be misrepresented.
But I do, because I have to, because the geography of self needs it.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, exactly what I've been saying.
I feel like I'm now building a very disquusive tension in the room, because I shouldn't have a dress.
Fortunately, I have something else to change.
This is the first time someone is attracted to the TED stage, so you can be happy to see this.
If a few women were really slipped out when I came out, you don't have to tell me this, I'm going to read that later on on on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in a very short 10 seconds, which I think you're thinking of.
And it doesn't have any chance to do that.
These are very uncomfortable pitches, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're going to get all of you to throw me off, so you're not going to do anything until it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
A image is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to throw my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgeries or the wrong brine that I used to take for the work two days ago, there are very few ways to change our utterance, and yet it's a superpicial and irreversible impact on our lives.
Being irresponsible is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a lovely white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery, and an important legacy, and you might be wondering what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, where we are mechanically programmed, but also as big, pompbling, feminine and bright-world.
This legacy was created for me. And it's an legacy that was offered for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion agentists might call, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra Smane. LG: Okay."
And first of all, I'm going to comment on your model, which is really impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, all the modules that have been counted on the lengths, every single one that was being seducted, and that from 677-tested modules, only 27 or less than four percent of the use of the day had not known.
The next question I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And I said to the first day, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you these little girls is, "Why?
Do you know what? You can get anything.
You can become President of America, or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja-law judge, which would be completely insane, because then you'd be the first."
If they still say after this great review, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "She my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for nothing, and you could be the editor of the American aviary or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to become a model later, it's like saying that you want to get the Jackpot in the Lotto.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career path.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a model of design, because otherwise, like heart surgery, it can only be unfolding.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is just like a nice flier, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo in the air," now the leg first, beautiful, and long, this arm goes back to the back, this arm is on the head of three-quarters, and you just move back and you see, you see, you know, 400-year-old friends, you know, you know, 400-olds.
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less odd than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and you have a life travel and you've done some jobs, you can't say much more. If you say you want to be President of the United States, but in the run is, "10 years of underwear," you're going to be looking at weird.
The next question I'm often asked is, "Who are you going to release all the photos?"
And yes, it's almost every single photograph that's being cleaned up, but that's just a small part of what's going on.
This is the first photograph I made, and that was the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my own period.
I know that's going to be quite personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months ago with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this film.
My friend had to be embarrassed.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a magazine party for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They are constructs, and they are constructed a group of professionals, Hairstylists and remix artists and stylists and all their assistants and their post-profinals. They build it. That's not me.
Okay, so next thing people always ask me, "Well, did you have to do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot-minted shoes I can never wear, except the things I get free are things I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a horrible driver, and she was driving a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took just one: "Sor, Mr. Words," and we could go on.
I've got these free things about my appearance, and I don't have people with my personality, and I think there are people who are interested in their appearance and not paying a lot of money for their personality.
I live in New York, and I live in the 140,000 teens who were being shot and shot in the last year, and 85 percent of the black and Latino, and most of the time, young men.
It's only 177,000 young men and Latino who don't think they were going to be asking the question: "Am I going to have a mind?"
It was, "How often am I going to quit? When am I going to quit?"
And when I was doing this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is up to 78 percent when they got 17 percent.
The last question I'm asking myself is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer to, "If you're a little bit thinner and you have glittery hair, you feel very happy and gorgeous."
And backstage, we'll give a answer that might be given to this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's just half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, what I've never said before the camera is, "I feel unconscious."
And I feel unsure because every day I have to think about my appearance.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Do I have happier if I had little hair and glittery hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool hogs, and they are the ones that are likely to be aware of their appearance of their apparent women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to get me to a more honest balance, because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to put myself in here and say, "I got all the benefits of a stack that was being dragged to my favor," and it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was very difficult to reveal a legacy of oppression for gender and race when I'm one of the biggest supplementants of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I've been really great to get it here before 10 or 20 years or 30 years of my career has been messed out, because I wouldn't probably tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I paid college to do that.
If you take a little bit of this talk, I hope we all recognize the power of the image in our supposed successes and failures more.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother that had come to life in exile: "Son, paddafi resistance. Gaddafi's ass.
But never be a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been around for almost two years since the Libyan revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass-grain weapons in both of the Tunisian revolution.
I connected with many other Libyians, within and outside, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gadaffi.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, licic women and men stood in the first row, asking the end of the regime, and the Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They proved an excellent mutant by asking for the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They showed a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east, across the far west, all the way to the South.
Finally, after a six-month period of brutal war and nearly 50,000 dead, we were able to liberate our country and to remove the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a great servant, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the process of change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannical regime has both destroyed infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges I realized, as many other women, would rebuild the civil society of Lybia, and we would ask for a treaty-public and a refinution to democracy and national justice.
Near to 200 organizations, while and immediately, Gaddafis in Benghazi, were founded almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of planning, I came back to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to organize human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peace platform of Libyians, a leadership movement of women, leaders of different life-song communities whose goal is to enter public nationalization for women, and to our right to equal rights to democracy and peacebuilding.
In the elections, I met in a very difficult environment, a environment that was dynamic, a environment that was shaped by the selfish political politics of dominance and execution.
I led an initiative to the Peace Continuum of Brazil to get a controlled strategy, a law that any citizen, no matter what the back should be, to vote for the right, and to take a demand for political parties, and to establish a common between male and female candidates in vertical and horizontal and a constant level of financial policy and a constant position to make a constant impact.
At the end, our initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the national Congress in the first elections since 52 years.
But it was very clear, but surely the history of elections and the entire revolution was about <unk> because every day we were looking for new news about violence.
We were looking for a morning to go to the marriage of ancient mosques and Sufi leaders.
In another morning, we got a message about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then again, another morning, the wounded were signed by the army's assaults.
And really every day, we're facing the sovereignty of the militians and the ongoing competitors against the human rights workers and their neglect of rules and laws.
Our society is formed by a revolutionary state of mind, polarized, and distant from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that she had at the beginning.
Intolerance, resistency, and revenge became the icon of the Folirieth century of revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our pressing gifts and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to confuse that as a nation, we've made false choices and false decisions.
We've set our priorities wrong.
Because elections didn't bring peace or stability or security to Lybias.
Did the hard-to-course and the change between women and male officials have brought peace and national acumen?
No, it doesn't.
So what is it?
Why is our society going to keep polarized and dominating politically governing and disoriented, both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones who missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the union.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus shift as it needed to strengthen the elections that have only strengthen the polarization and decoration.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it needs to have the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting on behalf of anger and ask a day of revenge.
We have to start acting on behalf of sympathy and the gistade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just claim the next values, but it also does it: Gade instead of revenge, cooperation instead of competition, rather than execution.
These are the ideals that desperately need to help you move from war to settlement to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in this alchemy, it's about the relis of the feminist and the masky view.
That's the real real fangs.
And we have to implement that in existential terms before we do it socio-Indically.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam" -- peace is "is the word of the Good God, rawled."
The word "raheem" again, which is known in all the aboriginal traditions, has the same Arab root as the word "rair," and symbolized the homaline feminine, all of humanity, all of the manhood and the female, of all the tribes and all the tribes have gone out.
And just like the mother's mother's heart, which grows in him, it's so much to keep the basic impact of compassion all of its existence.
And so they said, "My Gnade is all about things."
And so she said to us, "My Gnade has been pre-faced in front of my gret."
I think that all of us will be denied the space of the Gnade.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up using the song "nord" to be a little bit more.
And I was very proud.
In school, we were pushing the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world out there, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I was thinking about how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all this changeable time.
At seven years old, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a letter from the sister of a colleague.
And she said, "If you heard this, our five family members of the world will not be there anymore because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're lying down on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
And I was about to go through the railroad station and see something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A Saudi woman was lying on the ground, and a her mother was crushed in her arm was shining helplessly in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were all so busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-1990s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were killed to victims, and many more people were surviving because they were eating grasses, and they were eating frogs and tree lions.
Lights have become more and more and more abundant, so that at night, it's all too blurting me, except the lights of China on the other side of the fish that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the amp, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very steeped, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought I would be separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take me 14 years to revive again.
In China, it was very difficult to live without family.
I didn't have an idea of what life would be like as a North Korean refugee refugee. But I soon learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in silence that my real identity could fly through, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was realized when I was caught by the Chinese police police police and sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be a North Korean woman, so they tested my Chinese records and asked me countless questions.
I was so scared, I thought I was going to explode my heart.
Would anything unnatural, I could be imprisoned and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my feelings and answer the questions.
After they finished the poll, a official said to the other person, "That was a false failure.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are taking messages to foreign messages called Asyl, but many are caught by the Chinese police police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they were finally released by massive international printing press.
These North Koreans didn't have so much fortune.
Every year, there are numerous North Koreans in China, and they are rejected and they are being executed, imprisoned, or they are being executed in publicized.
Although I was lucky enough to escape, many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard for their survival.
After learning a new language and found work, their world can be turned on a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life again.
I was able to leave in South Korea, and I was able to make a bigger challenge than I thought I was going to have.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I've also noticed the difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've been very different from each other, because of 67 years of division.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northan-American?
Where am I from? Who am I?
And suddenly there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the adaptation to the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show at university.
Just as I became more common in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Korean authorities started the money I sent my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to relocated, to a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as fast as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself go to the northwest border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run them on more than 2,000 miles through China and then South Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we've been caught nearly a number of times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed, and told him they were a shower, and I was her lock.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily he believed me.
We made it to a moderate border, but I had to almost get all of my money to heat the border control of Laos.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was arrested because of illegal border crossing.
After having paid money and paid cash and paid cash, my family was released in a month, but shortly after that, my family was rebuilt back in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to heat my family to freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went and went from the immigration agency and the police department, trying to liberate my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back-of-life money or cash-worth.
I lost all my hope.
And the guy asked me the voice of a man, "What's wrong?"
I was totally surprised that a stranger was looking at it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without being annoyed, he went to a bank machine, and he paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger has shown me a new hope that the North Koreans needed so desperately, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were united in South Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they arrive in a new country, they start out with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, the workforce, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family agencies, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from within.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would want to be able to get a very hopeful North Koreans to succeed with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I have just a request today.
Don't want to tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big, and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares them unconditional, and he shares them inappropriate.
It's not stupid. It doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he singing songs from our childhood, he tries to think about words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: How little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has absolutely unfinished memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he was stolen my chocolate sweats, but he remembers every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while he was the first episode of the teapbies on my arm, and he was forced to punch his grandmother, Gagas's birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds are not in the social version of normal, they're often being over and understood wrong.
But what motivates my heart and strengthed my soul was that even though that was the case, although they were not seen as usual, it could only mean one: that they were extraordinary -- autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affect social communications, learning and physical abilities.
It's a different way of looking at every individual, and it's so much different from Remi than Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes, it's going to be noticed in a new person of autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been through autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very anxious.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and reorganized in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row of space, putting the washing machine and eating everything that was under him.
And when he got older, he became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the raver and the hidden hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been lied.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normality is the beauty that gives us differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be like you don't have to be normal.
You can be an extraordinary one.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each one of us has a gift in it. And in all of us, honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment that we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been upset with awe and curiosity, and this photo at the photo, he's leaking an apple and a cat-surpived war of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're faster, and we're not seeing the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto-M photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create a slow-time-time lens of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that can look beyond the perspective of our perspective or see out of corners without an <unk>-ray image in our body and ask really question what we mean with "Mamera."
Now if I take a laser pointer and I turn it out into a billionth of a second -- these are several femtoseconds -- I create a package of photons that's barely a millimeter wide, and this photonsite pack, this project will move in the speed of light, and it's going to go down into the speed of light, and it's like, a million times faster than a year ago.
So if you take this project, take this photons pack and shoot it into this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So, this whole event.
So, think about it, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotulator -- so long it takes the light to go back to that lane -- but I'm trying to get this video to see the order of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, comes in the bottle with a photon pack that starts moving through and then breaks through the inside.
So a part of the light is flowing outwards to the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
Many of the photons eventually get the steering of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that's sweeping around in the bottle.
And meanwhile, the waves spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see the reflection that the skin is focused at the end of the bottle after some images.
Now if you take a common project and you leave it back the same route, and you slow down the video by 10 billion, you know, how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a year.
It would be a very boring movie -- -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a still-time photographer?
You can see again, the waves of the table, the tips and the wall upside down over the background.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the nature of the painting of a photo, every single-to-face image, but of course our eye looks a stacked image.
But if you look at this Tom's, you'll see that if the light is rolling over the Tomate, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is coming up and the light jumps around you and comes back after a few billionth of a second.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you could go into a supermarket and see if a fruit is a fruit can't touch them.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with a short amount of moisture time, you have very little light, but we're going to have a billion times faster than your shortest waste of war, so you're going to get pretty much no light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons pack, a million-and-a-half-half-dimensional, and we're going to draw it back and forth with very clever synchron synchron synchron synchronizing, and we're going to combine this gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do some really interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make it invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superhero: to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to cool a little bit of light on the door.
It will be repaired, it will go into the room, and part of it will be reflected back to the door, and eventually we could use that additional amount of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually made it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden a puppet, and we're going to let the lights go down on the door.
After our paper was published in the National Communications Journal, it was taken out of Nature.com, and they made this animation.
We're going to take this light-out, and they're going to pop down on this wall, and this photons pack is being poured into all directions, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light, and then a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but they're going to be able to get really different at the top of the time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And so of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is that distance.
By making a laser light, we can record a raw image that can -- as you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but then if we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light-through-walks of light, then we can see the object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit more to do before we can put this into the lab in practice, we could build cars that avoid collisions and detect what's behind the curve, or we can search on dangerous distances of survivors by looking at light through open windows or we can build endcopes that look deep into the body around the womb and the goard.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's a very challenging thing, which is, really, a web call for scientists, now, thinking about Femto-M photography, because there's a new imaging process that could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, science has become an art, an art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time using not just the scientific design process. We can also create a new form of computer photography, and with paint-gracking, and all of which we can only look at the wave between those events between the wave of time.
But it's also a little bit fun here.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've seen almost in the speed of light, weird effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order of events in the world, in the brain, in the camera, is in a recreational order, so you can use the specific relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So whether you're focusing around photography or creating a new imaging tool for medicine or new exhibitions since our invention, we've been able to open up all the data and details on our website, hoping that the openers and creative developers are showing us that we should stop asking ourselves to the megapels of megels to start the next-dimensional images -- and to start the next-dimensional images --
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many conversations are not being passed down, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors, and use things like stickers, scratons and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do I pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we divide our memories to the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is gripped by the huge oak that has been welcoming for hundreds of years, drunk and crests and shardors. I have a trustful city where there's always music.
I think every time anyone never gets there in New Orleans, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the left parts in America.
I live in the house, and I thought about how I can make it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpectedly.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that are now important to me in life.
But it's hard for me to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose and forget what's really important in the daily lives.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a giant blackboard, and I wrote with a treasure wall of the gaps: "Fould I die, I want to die!" Everyone who can come back, take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share his hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely crowded, and it was growing on.
I want to share some sentences with you, which were written by the people on the wall.
"Fould I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"Fould I die, I want to stand across the International Recession line."
"Fould I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Fould I die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to live on "weed."
"Fould I die, I want to hold it in my arms."
"Fould I die, I want to be a person's cavicographer."
"Fould I die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people made me laugh, to cry and to moke, and to satisfy me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and trying to understand them in a new and unchanging way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I made a construction kit, and now now became a buildingbox in the world like Kazazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces, if we have the opportunity to stand up our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think life is short and delicate.
We're often being stopped talking about death or thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation to death is one of the things that strengthen us most.
The idea of death reflects us life.
Our common spaces are the best things that we can do as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, people can't just help us to create better places around us, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm looking at this on a very ambitious math. I'm doing a very special problem for anyone who's involved in this rigric math is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain to you today what I'm doing.
Teaching is one of the most common activities.
We are thrilled to look at the master's ring and beats of ballet and killers, as you'll see.
Now, the ballet is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and it's potentially a fundamental determination that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroyed this extraordinary ability. It also does it with my privileged Jan Abrival, who was a ballet deal.
Over the years, you've been doing a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to deal with the inevitable symptoms like weakness, tremor, and the stance and others who live on to live that disease, and so we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress objective, and ultimately, the only way to know whether there is a cure if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
In trouble, there's no biomarkalities for Parkinson's disease and other brain activity, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing you have is this 20-minute test at neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and it means, outside clinical studies, it's never going to be done. It's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have to be a senior hospital.
It costs 300 percent to actually explore in the neurological field.
So I want to suggest a unconventional method that we're trying to achieve this, because we're all, in a sense, virtual nutenens like my Iranian treripage.
So here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This is what happens in a healthy state, if someone is making a speech sounds. We can look at it as a mood maker, because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs if we can make sounds, and we all have the genes for it.com2, for example.
And how ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn to talk.
And by the sound of the sound, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and the way the limb is affected, the mood organ is affected by Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of irregular vocal resonance processing on the bottom.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Regissor, weakness, fistiness.
The language is even becoming a bit more agn and a wishing, and that's an example of aymptom.
Now, this impacts on the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision-based programming, combined with new machine learning, which is now very advanced, we can now tell where someone lies, in a spo between disease and health, just by the vocal sounds.
How can these tests take place with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test with neurologists.
It's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are accurate. They're not doing the right tests for this.
So they can be done independently.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in a large scale.
So we can do this amazing goals.
We can reduce logistic difficulty in patients.
Patients don't have to perform routine control control control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through widely seen.
We can do low-cost mass-valformance efforts for clinical trials and can be able to really reinvent the study of all the population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's Law Organization.
With Aculab and patient babies'sLike, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to own enough seed data for the access to these goals.
We have GPS numbers that are accessible to a billion people on this planet.
Anyone who, with no Parkinson's, can be a cheap call to leave a few cents for a few cents. I'm very familiar with joy that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of them, say, 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is the patient has to tell if this person has to suffer Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you may not get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in various circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we are in charge of these to detect what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy has its ability to do?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done such amazing work -- has shown now that it works on the cellular network, which allows this project to be done, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I'm going to call this a improvement.
So people can -- people can call up the phone and call the test. People could call it to Parkinson's disease, send their voice to check your doctor's progress on the effect of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya, in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the mine behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a branched in the South, and that means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at all.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night. I woke up in the morning and found them dead. It was horrible. It was our only Buest.
My tribe, the stem of the Maasa, believes that we were coming with our animals and the openland of heaven, and so our animals matter so much.
I was learning to hate lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our loved ones. They are also brought to this problem.
and they kill lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years of his father's cows. So I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that it wouldn't really help us, but it would help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird's drawing.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird shoots and you go back. But the next time they come, and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still here.
And they take off and kill our livestock.
One night, I woke up the bar. I walked around with a tap in the hand, and the lions didn't get to the fish.
lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working all day in my room, and I was able to take the new radio of my mother, and I was able to take it apart, and the day she was like, I was really learning a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a motor drive from a motorcycle. It suggests if you want to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I made a switch to turn the lights out and off.
This is a little phole from a broken pockets lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is integrating the battery, the battery is providing electricity to the driver's control plant. I call it a transformer.
And the driver's safety is bright.
You can see that the pins show outwards, because they come from there.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights blink, and the lions believe I'm walking around the rubble, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've installed this in our homes, and since then, we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights on. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really working really well.
My idea is now used all over Kenya, including other predators like hymen or Leopardians, and the lights are also used to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to give me a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helping fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights where there's no other, and I'm showing people how to use them.
I was just a boy from the savanna who was crying cows. I saw planes over me, and I said, "I'm going to sit in one of my day!"
And here I am.
I was invited to a plane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to hunt lions. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father, and we can put the lions together, we can live side of the side with the lions without any argument.
Ash<unk> Oln. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's next on the list?
My next invention, well, I'm working on an electrical fence. A electrode fence?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it once, don't you know -- I've tried it a little while, but I've given myself back to the test because I got a blow.
It's hard at all. Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you every step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I was old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite paintings, and I didn't have one of them.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no chance to shoot a picture, no matter what it was being considered to be used to the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I held my daughter on my arm on my first birthday. We were on the corner of 57th-sirsts and five-sirst.
And so a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this is going from ...
When my daughter's third birthday approached, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and make it a father-old boss to keep the ritual going on?"
And then we started asking the new tourists to start taking a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a whole stranger to take your camera.
Nobody has ever said no one, and fortunately nobody is ever cheering with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was taken just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day so that a five-year-old could understand it.
These images are much more than just a given moment or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us in October one week to keep the time and change the time we're coming from year to year, not just physically, but to reflect in everything.
Because while we keep making the same image, our perspective changes from time, as they're reaching up, new milestone, I can see life with their eyes as they're dealing with everything, and how they see it.
And this very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value, and we expect to be very late every year.
And so recently, while one of our trips, we walked around, and suddenly she was standing like this, and she was looking at a red tag on a tomato board that she had learned as a little kid, at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five years old at that point.
She said she remembers her heart hiding out of her chest when she saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks at high school schools in New York because she wants to study them in New York.
And I realized it was obvious. The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not at all a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come to the image and not ask someone, "Would you like to make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 27.14, 57.1/34.1/21.7/14.2 (BP=0.975, ration=0.976)
