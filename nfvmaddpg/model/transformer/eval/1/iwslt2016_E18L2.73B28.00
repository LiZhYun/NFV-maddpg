When I was 11 years old, I was hit by the sounds of a bright delight one morning.
My father listened to his little, gray radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual back then, because the news was often depressing.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power of Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned going to school.
And so I spent five years getting through my little boy and my older sister who was not allowed to go alone to a secret school.
And so we could both go to school.
Every day, we took another path so that no one could guess where we went.
We hidden our books in shopping bags so it looked like we were just going to buy a grocery store.
We were doing this in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was a bit agonous in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew we risk our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and again, the lesson had to be rejected for a week because the Taliban had been accused.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to tell us?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued and separated.
My grandfather was way ahead of his day.
He was a remote village of Afghanistan. He insisted to send my daughter -- my mother to school, and was rejected by his father.
My mother-I-I-d coached teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to retirement only to transform our house to school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family who ever received an education.
To him, he was always realized that his children would receive an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all risk.
He saw it as a much greater risk to not send his kids to school.
I know very clearly that in the years of the Taliban, I was so frustrated by our lives, the perpetual fear and the perspective of ignorance.
I had a good joke to give up, but my father said, "Hold, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be displaced in war.
But one thing is that you're going to stay in there. And even if we have to pay for your blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So -- do you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have a higher degree than a high school degree, and if my family hadn't been used so much for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudly seminal of the Midbury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first to congratulate me.
He doesn't just wear me with my graduate degree, but also I was the first woman and I was the car driving through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've been helping to start building SOLA, the first and perhaps the only board of girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls' school school school school is still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school have great ambition to see all of them as their individual opportunity.
And seeing their parents and fathers standing up for them, as my parents were then, despite all the attacks that were due to their abuses.
Like Ahmed, this is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is a father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter was his daughter, and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and she was the death of a bomb on the side of the road for a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang and a voice beat him if he sent his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, "Well, now, if you want to, I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the line because of your aging and over-expived ideas."
In Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often defending in the West: behind most of us who succeed, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and who realize that she's succeed.
That is not to say that our mothers are not going to have a very important role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are often expressed and persuasive to the future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, women's support is essential.
Under the Taliban, there were a few hundred girls going to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, so different.
Americans recognize how uncertain these changes are.
I suspect that changes are not long-lasted and they're changing everything with the U.S. troops.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, they're encouraging them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan for me is a country of hope and the unlimited possibility, and it reminds me of the girls who visit SOLA every day.
Just as I have, they have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, including professionally -- my life -- was coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, to 1977, I look young, but I don't -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working on the technologies of technology with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I think 21 years, we're a brilliant human race, and we've had good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples of the Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people of Italy to be the people of Sambia to be the production of food.
We got to the island of Italian seed in South Africa, in this compressed valley, which leads to Sambesi River, and we taught the local population to grow up in Italian tomato and tocini and ...
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest in this, so we paid them for work, and sometimes they began to appear.
We were amazed that in such a fertile valley, there was no agricultural agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Cice even in time to save people from the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderfully invested in Africa.
We had this gorgeous tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the Himalayan villages, "Look how simple agriculture is."
When the tomato was flipping and red, over the night, about 200 noders came from the river and grappls everything.
We said to the Himalayan novels, "Oh God, the nerdy!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have farming here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were an Italian person in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French people did, and after seeing what they did, I became pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the nenters.
You should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense that we've given to the unseen African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a South-American scientist.
The book was published in 2009.
We Dutch countries have given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has taken.
Just read their book.
Read about a African African, what we've done.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways that we deal with people, and we locate them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "father."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchical: I treat every other culture as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronisens: I treat any other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bug," the boss.
I was getting happy when I read the book "sall's Beautiful" by cheating. He said, especially in economic development, if people don't want help, they leave you alone.
This was the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, took a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolatial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and I invented a system called corporate promotion, which is never being launched, never gets any one motivated, but you're going to be the CEO of the local passion, the servant of the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you keep the mouth.
You never get to a community with ideas, you put them together with the local locals.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in kitchipens.
We have no infrastructure.
We close our friends, and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for the human growth is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important human.
We're helping them find knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea might not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why, instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we listen to them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
Entrepreneurs never have been part of the organization, and they will never say public what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Design has this lightbulbs.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to public meetings.
We work one to one to do that has to be made a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the hospital of the company, sitting with you in the house, sitting in your kitchen table, helping you find the means to transform your passion in a way that transform your life.
I've tried this in Esperance, West Australia.
I was a little bit pre-founded at the time, and I was trying to escape the veil of disobting, where we tell others what to do.
And so I walked around the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, I helped him. He helped him. He was a floating fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth, and he would come to participate, and they would come and say, "You have helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers to work together and not sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents a year, but to Japan for Sushi for 15 dollars. And then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped us do this?"
I had 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I keep the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- -- and the government says, "Go ahead."
We did it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on on on loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business advisers in history, died at 96 years ago.
Peter's Machine was a philosophy teacher before he was looking at companies. Peter's printer: Design is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and the economy."
Design is the death penalty of the public spirit.
So you build Christchurch without knowing what the smartest human being Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You need to learn how to get that to one.
You have to provide them discretion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to come in.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What presentation do you most cheated for tomorrow?
<unk>uite loving, passionate people. You hated that.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- the precursor fossil fuels, the manufacturing process -- and all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The open species of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in a sustainable way, to be able to transport, to transport, to share them with them.
The technologies don't exist for that.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Do universities? Forget it.
The government? Forget.
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and they created what would happen in the city of New York, and the conclusion was, New York City would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows in the speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get the crap done with six million horses.
Because they were already going in crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, in the United States, there were 1001 automotive manufacturer -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the backyard.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered discretion.
Otherwise, they don't come and speak to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, dedicated and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all needs to be able to do three things: to sell the product, to be great, to be the market market market market, and to be the financial public.
Guess what?
We never met a single person who can also produce something, sell and care for money.
That's not what it means.
This person never was born.
We did research and we looked at the 100 iconiest companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have, only one thing that's founded is not just one person.
Now we teach 16 years of Northeast entrepreneurship, and we start giving them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Autobiography, which is the job of the 16 year-old girl, to support the first two sides by Richard Bransons Autography, how often he uses the word "I," and often the word "we" as "we."
Never "I" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he began.
No one founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small residential background, sit in cafes and bars. Their dedicated buddy, who will do for them, what someone did for this gentleman who speaks about this Einness. Somebody will say, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are helping organizations find the means of using the tools and the people. We've found that the wonders of the human population can cause the culture and the economy of this community to change, just by taking the passions, energy and imagination of the people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've been learning about being a good thing to be at Alice's wonderfulland.
So Penn State University asked me -- a faculty for communications -- to share education in communication.
I was afraid.
It's really fear. It's fear of these students with their large brains and their large books and their big books, I don't trust them.
But when the conversation came to change, he turned it back to me like Alice, when she got down to the pig's chicken and saw a door to a new world.
I just felt like I was interviewing students, and I was amazed by the thoughts they had, and I wanted others to find that other kind of wonder.
I think to open up these towers, it requires great communication.
We need some great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy, environment, health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go ahead. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religist.
But these great conversations don't come from when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
So I want to show you a few of the approaches that you can do, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're busy with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, well, what?
Let's tell you why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only does your cheeks study, but also tell us that their cheeks, their pillods, their little structure in our bones, are examined because it's important to understand and treat ooporosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you're not going to get the word "nothing"
Now, the dictionary is a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use "diving" and "time" in a while, but why don't you just say "play and time," what is much more understandable for us?
Now, making your thoughts understandable is not the same as they're atropheting your level.
As Einstein said, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with compromise.
So a few things are related to this: examples, stories and analogies. That's how you can pull us into your worm.
And when you present your work, the dots are going to go away.
Have you ever asked why it's called the point?
What happens when someone points? One is getting stabbed, and with those dots you get to your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also fits too much on the conversation-making part of our brain, and so we're very quick to be challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more potent. It shows that the specific structure of the spine is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
So the trick here is to use a single, simple sentence that the audience can react to once it loses the thread, re-seeking images and graphics that also inform our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what you're describing.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up this door and see the wonders that science and technology can come in.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to connect with the "A lovers" button in me, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
Now, look at your science and your preconceptions and your scientific wisdom, these are the ones that are all about the relevance, so the audience is important, and they multiply the passion that you have for your incredible work: And that comes out of that, you get the incredible, visible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solve this equation, I'm really excited about it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
If you have a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get high-petched and famous on sound cloud.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Berlin in 1904, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this city.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going to the street and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're wondering that all these people who were coming together and asking change had a cell phone in the bag.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, my friend and my cell phone wants to talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 points of information.
We have raw data.
And why are the information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.A. has set up a policy.
This is a policy changer for law enforcement.
This policy is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service operator in Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls who? Who's going to send an email?
Who is going to send a text message to whom?
And if you use a cell phone, where you're a cell phone.
All this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your telephone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people have been coming up and said, "We don't want that."
They said, we don't want to have this reserve protection.
We want to have self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of whom said, "We don't want that."
And here you can see tens of thousands of people flocking out on the streets of Berlin, saying, "Freedom for fear."
And some people even said this could be a St. 2.0.
The Stors was the Limpol police in eastern Germany.
And I also wonder if this really works.
Can the really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Declagina Telecom, who was the world's largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, let me give all the information you saved me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get a right answer. Only a half-blood Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's her plateing.
So I decided to put a court of trial against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German Telecom said no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end, it was a comparison with them.
I'm going to take the message back, which they're going to send me all the information that they were asking me.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court mandated that the E.U. government issued a lawsuit in German law.
So I got this ugly brown pulse with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 points of information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My drive.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to get published.
Because I want to show people what a reserve protection is.
So with time online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and down.
You can track every step I do.
And you can even see how I'm driving from Frankfurt with the train to Köln, and how many calls I'm going to walk along.
And this is all possible by this information.
It's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then a few friends call me up, and they call each other.
And after a while, you're going to call you, and you're going to call you, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, what time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who is the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a design plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who to whom to send an email, all of that is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said in the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the beard knew who was at the demonstration, and if the St.C., had known who was the leader, that might have never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, perhaps it wouldn't have happened.
And again, not the case of the iron curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so much information as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all long.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for it every day.
So when you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century worth, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, tell your permaver, just because companies and state countries have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it yet.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to struggle for self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiral shops, rapid restaurants, brkops.
So the city planners come together and they survived changing the name of South Central so that they're for something else, they're changing it in South Los Angeles, as if that changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Impatching shops, rapid restaurants, brideops.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the Drivebys.
The funny thing is that the Drive-thrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles from curable diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it was in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't catch that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you had no access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, you see the negative effects that have the existing food system on your neighborhood.
I realize that roll-up is bought and sold as a vehicle.
I see a dialogian mask going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what it has to stop.
I realized the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't like that anymore at 45 minutes' national leave to get an apple that's not labeled with pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call parking lots.
It's 45 to three feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility and I have to be in charge."
And I decided to keep it in the same way.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, together, and we started planting my food forest, and fruit trees, which is the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of executive group, together from gardening from all walks of social backgrounds and from all over the city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came to me, and he basically assigned me a station, and said I need to remove my garden, the supply was going to become a champion.
And I thought, "Okay, come on, right?
A leader of food production on a piece of food that you're completely not comfortable with?"
And I thought, "Cool. Herself."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from this. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and spoke to the town of town, and a member of Green Ground Ground, and they made a petition on Change.org, and 900 signatures we succeeded.
We held the victory in our hands.
My town actually called up to me and said they're supporting it and loving what we're doing.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most store in the United States in the property of the city.
They have 4,600 square kilometers in the field.
That's 20 Central parks.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should they not find it okay?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my treasure message, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
Taking food is like printing your own money.
See, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew my sons there.
And I dare be part of this preficial reality made by other people, and I built my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
My garden work is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just as a graffiti artist who's been capturing walls, I'm going to wear lawns and park equipment.
I use the garden, the earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my valves for this stuff.
You would be surprised what the ground can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as my garden became an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the floor.
You would be wondering how children are influenced by this.
So gardening is the most therapeutic and most bold act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you can also get strawberry strawberry.
I remember that time that her mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 a.m. at night. They were in my garden, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason for the road."
I was ashamed when I saw people who were so close and hungry and so much, and that just empowered me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, don't worry about people being stealing your food."
And I said, "One devil, no, I'm not afraid they're going to make a mistake.
And that's the street.
So that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
On another time, I put a garden in this homeless garden in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me out the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted with their mother and their grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even though only for a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people who came and they had to do it, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, babies eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they're not offered anything about it, if they're not shown how food and body impacts, they're blind, whatever you're going to call them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that they were looking for, and that leads nowhere to it.
I think of the gardening as an opportunity to train these kids to care for their communities to live a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipping cards and turn them into a healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free stop, because free is not sustainable.
The great thing about sustainability is that you have to stop it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and letting them experience the pride and honor and honor when you build their own food, and when you open up farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to be able to become all environmental rebel, gangsters, gang gardeners.
We need to turn the picture of the gait.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You know, you're going to get a napkin, right?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're going to sit in the square chairs and do a meeting where you're talking about doing some math.
If you want to meet me, come with your taps, in my garden, so that we can plant some shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "snollygoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "snollygoster" means "surious officials."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher gave birth to a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who is waiting for an office, independent party, program or mission, and will achieve its success by the sheer power of the monumental anatomy."
I have no idea what the process is.
Something I think about words.
But it's very important that words are at the heart of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers didn't get the exact same vocabulary of debutings.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who began to look at Parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it up, but he was courageous enough, he was brave enough to pursue, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first sign for the sentence "so strong like Brass." Many people think.
So the English word is pasted for the tin.
But that's not true. It's back to a confirmation of the press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time that it just accomplished independence.
And you could think about the question of, what do you call George Washington, the state of state?
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a national nation?
There was a long discussion about this in Congress.
And there were all kinds of predictable suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-city George Washington, and other people, and the regulators of the rest of the United States of America in Washington.
Not that special.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it was possible.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a particular period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with a little bit of embarrassment, because this debate lasted three weeks.
I read the diary book that always writes, "I've got the same issue."
The reason why the ticking and the boredom was that the Kansas House was against the Senate.
The Kansas House of Representatives didn't want to be the Washington Dicgier. They didn't want to.
King Amende, and maybe even gives him ideas to follow.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most pestest, stupid title that they could think of.
This title was "The Princeor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he just meant that someone was complaining.
It's kind of like the firing of a jury.
He had no longer been the size of the book "playing" or "compassate water."
Sometimes there were a couple of senior members of the public and government groups, but it was really a non-unimate title.
That's why the Senate refused to give it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up agreements and meet foreign wage.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks, the Senate didn't come.
Instead, it was meant to be the ultimate author to use the word "diction" to be the author, but they wanted to make sure that they didn't agree with their honest respect for the opinions and civilized nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, where it's the office of the state of the presidency -- not necessarily validating the presidency, and the United States, the other nations who are concerned with the rest of the rest of
You can learn three interesting things from this.
First, and I think that's best -- I don't know if the Senate ever really really really really really really really really really really appreciated the Secretary of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, is just a proud name. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government tells you that something is temporary -- -- -- then you're going to wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is that the most important point is that the United States's "Amor of America" today doesn't sound so humorous, right?
It has to do with the kind of 5,000-fifths of nuclear arms that it has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title.
And that's how the Senate ended.
They got a respectful title.
And the other concern about the Senate, the meaning of insign grasor -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end of the day, the Senate would lose and the representation of the house, because nobody feels humbling when you're told you're the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away, and that's what I'm going to leave with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I got to a truck about 50 Rebel at the war of jlaalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I wipe my black-blood half-white gloves against a pair of brown leather and a rocket headed towards the government hospital, which I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been a war big before, but I've had become a little bit of a war, but I've had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a guy who had been a war with Pyjama party and a sports show that I knew was going to work with.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I stand here, a kind of, a kind of, a kind of a woman named Afghans, Southeast of God's Gnad. An atheist, and a radical political artist who has been working and created for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So, there's a lot of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like a rainbow. I want to make art that compares the personality and informs authority and rewriting the reality and even using a kind of a kind of imaginative citizenship to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- a word that involves promoting his jihad against communist, like "Popheadheadheading" and using armed anxiety and political corruption to enrich.
And what else could the jihadist first do when the parliament should go for a job and do a campaign with the slogan, "Take me! I'm a jihad, and I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to disappoint this mafiosi that are used as a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption of Afghanistan, with a project called "reachstour," where you call yourself a police station, build a false control site on the streets of Kabul, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money to the police department in Kabul, and giving them permission to them, and hope that they accept 100 in Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the Intermodest conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine the furs of local Afghan people with a protective clothing or several different warehouse in a moderate, rural, secular art.
And I'd like to see what a simple pusher looks like from Kabul, between Kiplell's Appell, to create a dialogue about how modern development institutions are going to have its origins in the past- past colonial rhetoric about "The White Dine Beauty" to protect the brown man from themselves and maybe even to devy a little civil.
But for all of these things, you can come to jail, you can be misunderstood.
But I do, because I have to because the geography of self needs it.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for some time I've been a model.
For 10 years, I've been saying it.
I feel like this is now a room that's now building an incredibly uncomfortable tension, because I shouldn't have been dressed in that dress.
Fortunately, I have something else to change.
This is the first time someone is going to be attracted to the TED stage, so you can be happy to see this, I think.
If some women were really excited when I came out, you don't need me to say this, I'll read this later on on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds in a very short way, which you think of me.
And that's not the only way everyone has the chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're going to let me know you're not going to do anything until it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Now, it was hopefully not as embarrassing as this picture.
A visual is powerful, but a visual is also superficial.
I just changed your mind completely in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to throw my back and put my hand in the hair of that guy.
And apart from surgery or the wrong brine that I used to do for the work two days ago, there's very few ways to change our utterance, and yet it's superficial and irreversible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being fearless is for me to be honest today.
And I stand on this stage because I'm a model.
I stand on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my industry, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I'm always going to say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a net in the genetic lottery, and a critical legacy, and maybe you wonder what this legacy is about.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not just as healthy and young and symmetrical, where we are biologically programmed, but also as big, pounding, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been sold for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion artists might call, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smrow. Liu Wen."
And first, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious student at NYU counted all the modules on the run, each one of them being rented, and that from 677 species were only only un-spired as 27 or fewer than four percent.
The next question that always gets asked me is, "Can I become a model if I grow up?"
And I say first of all, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give is, why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja Heart surgeon, which is completely crazy, because then you're the first one."
If they still say after this great interrogation, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "She the boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the president of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to become a model later, it's like saying that you want to win the Jackpot in the Lotto.
You can't change it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of a model of design, because unlike heart surgeons, it can just be unfolding right now.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is just like a nice tube there, and the client says, "Cameron, we want to run a picture," now the leg first, going really, beautiful, long, and long, this arm goes back, this arm is on the front, and the head is on three-quarters of three and you just move back, and then you can see back to your previous, 400-second, 400 friends.
It looks something like this.
I hope it's less strange than it does in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and have a few jobs going on, and you're not going to have a lot of jobs, and you're not going to say that when you want to be President of the United States, but in the life, you're going to be looking at "10 years underwear."
The next question that I'm often asked is, "Whoever is going to beat all the photos?"
And yes, pretty much all the photos are being cleaned, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I made, and this was the very first time I carried a Bikini. I didn't even have my period at the time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal now, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months ago, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the magazine.
My girlfriend had to come and sing me.
This is me on a Pyjama party a few days ago, a magazine for French birdgy.
This is me with the football team and in V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you'll see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, Hairstylists and remixers and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and post-production. They build it. I'm not.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Well, did you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-meter-hopping shoes I can never carry, except for the things I get free, are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she was walking over a red light, and of course we were stopped. It was like, "Excuse me, Mr. Wachtters," and we could go on.
I got these free things because of my appearance, and I don't have people who look like them, because of their appearance, and they don't pay a lot of money for their personality.
I live in New York, and I live in the 140,000 teens who have been shot and filtered last year, 85 percent black and Latino, and most of the time, young men.
It's only 177,000 young black black black and Latino people who don't think of the question: "Am I stopping?"
But, "How many times am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
So when I was researching this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is 78 percent, when they became 17.
The last question I have to ask myself is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting that answer to, "If you're a little bit thin and a glossy hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backstage, we'll give a answer that might be given to this.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never say before the camera is what I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I going to be happier if I had thin legs and gliny hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest puppies that you can see on the planet, and they're probably the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I've been preparing this talk, it seems very difficult to me to get a very honest balance, because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come here and say, "I got all the benefits from a stack that was going to be fading to my favor," and it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that doesn't always make me happy."
It was very difficult to really open up a heritage of oppression for gender and race if I'm one of the largest benefentiaries of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm also honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done this here before 10 or 20 years or 30 years ago, and my career has been still filled with my career, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I paid college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our supposed successes and failures more.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother that had come to life in exile: "Son, paddafi Resistance. Giever him.
But I'll never be a bit like a Gaddafi Revolution."
It's been now almost two years since the Libyan Revolution has been broken by the waves of mass mass mass destruction in both those who are in the Egyptian Revolution.
I joined many other Libyians, within and outside Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a great revolution.
Young, licensed women and men stood in the first row, the end of the regime, leaned Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They proved an astronomer by asking for the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west, to the south.
After six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 deaths, we were able to free our country and to avoid the tyranny.
But Gaddafi did not leave a great burden, a legacy of the tyranny, corruption and the basis of the change.
Over the course of four decades, Gaddafis tyrannic regimes have both destroyed infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
I realized the destruction and the challenges that I would have, as many women, to rebuild the civil society of Lybacia, and we would ask for a predatory and unchanging transition to democracy and national justice.
Near to 200 organizations, while immediately Gaddafis was founded in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I returned to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I began to organize workshops to performations, human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Liby Women, a leadership movement of various different forms of life, whose goal is to be public for the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and to our right for equal leadership for democracy and peace.
In the elections, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was vastly polarized, a environment that was defined by the selfish political politics of dominance and execution.
I led a mission of the peace collection of Liby women to achieve a regulator rule, a law that any citizen, no matter what the right to vote and take for a job and take a stand-off and especially for political parties to try to confront a culture between male and female and large-scale and horizontal-scale and lead a need-to-step solution.
At the end, our initiative was over and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the national jurisdictions for the first 52 years.
But it was very, very clearly, the history of elections and the entire revolution, because every day we started to look at new news about violence.
We went to the marriage of ancient mosques and Sufi masters of the morning.
On another morning, we got a message about the murder of American ambassador and attack.
And then another morning, the wounded were registered by the army's army.
And we really, every day, we become aware of the tyranny of militias and the advances against the human rights and the death penalty opponents of laws and laws.
Our society is formed by a revolutionary human state, polarized, distant from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice -- that it was at the beginning.
Intolerance, decay and revenge became the icon of the Industrial Revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you about the success story of our pressing list and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to tell you that as a nation, we made false choices and false decisions.
We've got a wrong set of priorities.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or safety in Lybias.
Has the re-expaying list and the change between female and male officials led peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it then?
Why is our society going to keep polarized and dominating the tyranny and purpose of Islam, both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones to miss, but the female values of compassion, the Gouade and the purpose.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus gap as it needed to have elections, which is only ultimately strengthening polarization and decoration.
Our society needs the qualitatively mediating quality of the female than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting on behalf of the anger and demand a day of revenge.
We need to start acting on behalf of sympathy and the Gardade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just claim the next values, but also it's also the case: Gade instead of revenge, cooperation rather than competition, rather than execution.
These are the ideals that need to be fought by war,
Because peace has an alchemy, and in that alchemy, it's about the relocation of feminine and maskal viewings.
That's the real fangs.
And we need to do that in existential terms before we do it socio-Indically.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam" -- "Long the word of the Good God, raping."
The word "raheem" again known in all the abouted cultural traditions has the same Arabic root as the word "inason" and symbolizes the homemine feminine feminine who surrounds all humanity, the man and the man of the man and the female, all of the tribes and all the tribes that have gone out.
And just like the mother's mother's heart, which grows in him, completely surrounds the basic nature of compassion.
And that's why we were told, "My Gnade is all things."
And that's why we were told, "My Gnade has been pre-fist before my Groel."
I want to say that we can all be saved by the Gardian.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up using the song "nary" to envy.
And I was very proud.
In school, we were touring the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world out there, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Even though I often wondered what the outside world is, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until a change of change.
When I was seven years old, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer any hunger.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from a sister of a colleague of mine.
And she said, "If you heard this, our five family members of the world will not be on the planet anymore, because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're all on the ground together, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country were dying.
Shortly after that, I went past the station and saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A bleeding woman was lying on the ground, and a ripped child in her arm looked helpless to his mother's face.
But no one helped them because everyone was busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'90s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North American famine were dying, and many more people just survived because they ate grasses, bugs and tree canopy.
So electricity levels became increasingly, so that at night everything was too darkening, except for the lights of China on the other side of the tag that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the amp, part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very scary, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of deaths.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine was sent to China to the remote relatives.
I just thought I would be separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take me 14 years to work again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have any idea of what life would be like as a North Korean refugee survivor, but soon I learned it's not just incredibly difficult, but it's very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in a constant fear that my true identity could fly in, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police police officer and sent to the police department.
Somebody gave me a loan to be a North Korean woman, so they tested my Chinese names and they asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought about my heart being melting.
So if anything is unnatural, I could be locked up and rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the polling, a citizen said to the other one, "This was a false failure.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are scrambling in foreign messages called Ayl, but many are caught by the Chinese police police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they got caught, they eventually got released because of immense international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have that much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and they are rejected to North Korea, where they are tortured, imprisoned or legally owned.
Although I was lucky enough to escape, many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and struggle for survival.
After learning a new language and finding work, their world can be turned upside down at a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I had a bigger challenge in South Korea in South Korea than I would have thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And I also saw the big difference between North Korea and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've been very divergent, because of 67 years of division.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northan-aged?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, no other country that could have been my home.
Even though I didn't quite get the adaptation to the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show of the university.
Just as I became more successful in my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Bronx authorities started the money I sent my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to relocated to a remote place on the country.
They had to escape as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go through an incredible route on their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, ironically I took a flight back to China, and I made my way to the North Korean border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I needed to run them for more than 2,000 miles in China, and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride lasted a week, and we got almost several times caught.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the idea of everybody, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed, and told him they were a shower, and I was her confer.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to go all the way to the mercy border, but I had to do almost all my money to get the boundary control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family has been imprisoned because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and scrapers, my family was released within a month, but shortly after that, my family was re-founded, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest disengrings of my life.
I had done everything I could to protect my family to be free, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went back and forth between the foreign authorities and the police department, trying to help me escape my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for the bribe or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then a man's voice asked me, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is looking for it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without going to a bank factory, and he paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get it out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the Northan Canal Man."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger represented me a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope-makers who need the North Koreans.
After our long journey, my family and I were united in South Korea, but the freedom to gain is just one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they arrive in a new country, they start out with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, professional education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family workers, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to have so much help and inspiration in my life, that I hope I would want to be successful in North Koreans with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including at TED stage.
Thank you.
I've just got one request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce my brothers to this.
Remi is two2, big, and very good.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't do.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it unconditional, and he shares it unconditional.
It's not stupid. It doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, for words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: How little we know about the minds and how wonderfully the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's big. He's very good.
It has a perfectly unthinkable memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate broadens, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, talking about four when he was four, and the first episode of the teapleties on my arm, and the Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't listen to it?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and understood and wrong.
But what encouraged my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though it was not common in the past, it could only mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affect social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a different kind of a different kind of a visual for each individual, so Remi is different from Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes in a new person is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing life disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've encountered autism, but I can't remember it every day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very much.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and reigned in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like putting cars in a row of space, tying the washing machine and eating everything that was coming under him.
And when he got older, he became different, and the differences became apparent.
But behind the anger and the silent and the never ending hyperactivity was something really unique: a simple and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never been lied.
Remarkable.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normal is the beauty that we have to tell us the differences that we are different, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it. And all of us, honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has been a reminder of awe and curiosity, and this is a project that has a apple-length deleted and a cat-lained cat for just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we see the world not with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create a slow motion of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look outside of our viewpoints and see out of the corners of the universe, or even an <unk>-ray image in our bodies, and really ask what we mean with my camera.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it into a billionth of a second -- these are several femtoseconds -- I'll get a package of photons that are barely a millimeter wide, and this photon pack, this project, will move in the speed of light, and it's said -- a million times faster than a normal project.
So, if you take this project, this photon pack and you shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event.
So remember, this whole event actually takes less than a nanotone -- as long as the light required to go back this route -- but I'm trying to figure out what's the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, is going to be put in the bottle with a photon pack that starts to move through and eventually breaks in.
Part of the light goes outwards out to the table, and you see that spreading the waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the melting of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble there that's sweeping around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflective events you see that the reflection at the end of the bottle are focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and let it go back the same route and slow the video back at 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project of motion.
And what about something still-time photography?
You can see the waves going back to the table, the Tomate and the wall flowing in the background.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed to me that nature would paint a photo like this, each of these a femto image, but of course our eye is a composed of individual image.
But if you look at these Tom's orbit again, you'll see that when the light goes over the Tomite, it's going to keep going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomate has arrived and the light jumps in it and comes back to a few billionth of the seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your bedroom's bedroom, it could be possible that you could go to a supermarket and see if a fruit is mature, without touching it.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture with a very short amount of moisture, you have very little light, but we're going to adjust a billion times faster than your shortest heat time, so you're not getting as good as any light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon pack, a million times, and we're going to draw this again with very clever synchronization, and we're going to combine this gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do some interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superhero: Can we see corners?
The idea is that we're going to suck up a little bit of light on the door.
It will be chattering into space, some of it will bounce back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use these multi-stranded lightbulbs.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left you see our femto camera.
Behind the wall is a puppet hidden, and we're going to let the light go off the door.
After our paper was published in the National Communications Journal, it was taken by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to be rid of this light project, and they're going to pop up on this wall, and this photon pack is going to be streaming all the way around, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup that will then let the light be able to break, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light, and then a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but interesting to the very close to the next time
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And that's why we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point is what distance you're hearing.
So by making a laser light, we can record a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- don't really make sense, but then when we take lots of these pictures, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the various light-through the screen, then we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have some more work to do before we can do this in the field of practice, we could build cars that are remote and know what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous dawns of survivors, by looking at light through the open windows, or we can build endcones that look deep in the body around Okhacketops and also the right whale.
But because of the blood and tissues, of course, it's very challenging, which is why this is really a wake-up call for scientists to think about Femto-D photography, because a new one-time architecture process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as in Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, science has become a multicillion-second art, an ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we're collecting every single time, not just using scientific design, but we can also create a new form of computer photography, with paint and color recognition, and we can look at all of these wave points between the time.
But it's also a little bit fun.
If you look at these waves under the tube, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we, because we have nearly in the speed of light, have weird effects, and Einstein would love to see this picture.
The sequence that happens in the world is in the brain of events that appear in a recurrence of the camera, which is by applying the context of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So whether it's for photography to be around, or to create a new representation for medicine or new exhibitions since our invention, we've been able to digitally digitally and details on our website, and hope that the "pierakers" and the creative community will show us that we should stop to advance the megapels of the microscopes -- to be able to map up on the next dimension, and to be able to be able to map up on the next time.
It's about time. Thank you.
There's a lot of ways that we can make our own life better.
We don't meet every other neighbors on the street so that many of the discussions are not passed, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the past few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors, using things like stickers, tiltons and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do I have to pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the vacant houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is freeed by the huge oak that for hundreds of years of loving, drunk and dreumbling shadows, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time anyone never gets, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the most abandoned parts in America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I can get it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great grateful gratitude for my life, and it brought me clarity about the things that are important to me now in life.
But it's hard for me to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose and forget about what's really important in the daily lives.
With the help of old and new friends, I transform a page of the abandoned house into a giant blackboard, and I wrote with a treasonial wall, "Before I die, I want to die, I want to -- anyone who can come back, can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely filled, and it was growing.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the people on the wall.
"Before I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"Before I die, I want to stand across the International Recession."
"Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."
"Before I die, I want to live in "weed."
"Before I die, I want to hold it in my arms again."
"Before I die, I want to be a puppal."
"Before I die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to cry and to moll and moll me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and in a new and unchanging way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking and remembering what's most important in our own growing and changing.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of news stories from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, and so my colleagues and I built a construction kit, and now in the world, in Southeast countries like Kazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina, and other walls.
We've shown how much power our public spaces have when we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think life is short and delicate.
We're often going to be keeping track of talking about death, or even thinking about death, but I've realized that the preparation for death is one of the things that strengthens us most.
The idea of death reflects us life.
Our common spaces are the best things that we can do as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and our fears and stories, people can not just help us to create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm looking at the math that I'm looking at. A particular problem for anyone who's been looking at these on a targeted math, is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try to explain what I do.
Teaching is one of the most human activities.
We are delighted at the sight of the wrestling ballet and couple of beers that you're going to see.
So for a ballet, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and maybe a fundamental signal that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It also does what I know about my renamed Jan Stripling, which at the time he was a balletgy.
Over the years, you've been making a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the inevitable symptoms like weaknesses, tremor, adultery, and others who are living, and that is why we need to have objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress objective, and ultimately, the only way to really know if there is a cure if we have an objective measure that can answer that question.
In trouble, Parkinson's disease and other people have no biomarker, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that's there is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies, it's never done. Never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a lone tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't need to be a working hospital.
It costs 300 percent to actually explore in the neurological department.
So I want to suggest a very unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a sense, virtual illusions like my Iranian junit.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal sound.
This is what happens in a healthy state when someone creates a speech set, we can look at it as a vocal ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all of these vocal organs if we make these sounds, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
And like ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to talk until they learn.
By the way that sound, we can tell the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and just like the limb is affected by Parkinson's vocal organs.
On the lower record, you can see an example of irregular vocal foxing.
We always see the same symptoms.
Regorious, weakness, perseverance.
The language is even becoming a bittern and a wizzy and a little bit of an example of it.
And these impacts can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision-based data, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now tell where someone lies in a spo between disease and health, because of the vocal sounds.
How can these tests measure with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test in neurologists.
It's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both of them are accurate. They're not exactly the right answer for this.
So they can be done by themselves.
They're very fast, they're at the maximum 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it at a very large scale.
So here's the amazing goals we can do.
We can reduce logistic difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to perform routine checks in the hospital.
We can gain objective data through a common observation.
We can do low-cost massage approaches for clinical trials, and we can first study the entire population.
We now have the possibility to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's Law Organization.
With Aculab and patient'sLike, we want to take a very large number of voices around the world to have enough initial data for the success of these goals.
We have calls numbers that are accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on the planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease can call a cheap one to leave a few-cent-a-half-hour recordings. I'm very lucky to say we've reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from them, say, 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to tell if this person has Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of you might not get it to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in various circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are to exploit them to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy is true?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I need to praise him because he did such fantastic work -- has shown that it also works on the cellular network, which allows this project to be done, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
That means people can -- people can call and do the test with the cell. People with Parkinson's disease could call their voice, so their doctor can check the progress of disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and the mine behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a very narrow area in the South, which means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, they follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows killed at night, and I woke up in the morning and found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buitt.
My tribe, the colony of the Masai, believes that we came with our animals and our open land of heaven, and that's why our animals mean so much.
I was a child who had only learned to hate lions.
Our warrior name is Morans. They protect our tribe and our enemies. They're also brought to this problem because of this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why in Nairobi National Park is just as few lions.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years of marriage for his father. That's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Beus fear of fire.
But then I realized that this would not really help us, but to help the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried with a bird's surf.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow shed.
But lions are very clever animals.
You come, you see the bird magazines come back and forth, but the next time they come, and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still here.
And they reach out and kill our livestock.
One night, I woke up the cover. I walked around a furge in the hand, and that time the lions didn't get the mark.
Beor fearful of light that moves.
I had an idea.
I spent a little boy working all day in my bedroom, and I even took the new radio from my mother, and the day she got me almost around, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a control plant from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn right or left. It blinks.
And I got a switch to turn off the lights.
This is a little leaf from a broken flashlight.
And then I built it all together.
The solar panel will propel the battery, the battery will provide electricity to the right-player. I call it a transformer.
And the right to the right is the ruminous.
You can see that the eagle is pointing outwards, because from where the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights blink, and the lions believe I'm walking around the rubble, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our homes like this, and since then we have no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights on. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've fed seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good at doing.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including for other predators like hyena or leopard seals, and the lights are also meant to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to go to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is dedicated to fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we put the lights where there's no other, and I'm showing people how to use them.
I was just a boy from the savanna who was saping his father's cows. I saw planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one day."
And here I am.
I was invited to get a plane ride for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to hunt lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father, and we can share them together, side by side, live with the lions, without arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's next on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. A electroconceic fence?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right, yeah -- I've tried it a little while, but I've given a try, because I got a blow.
It's hard. Richard Turer, you're special.
We're going to hire you every step of your singing, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite slides, and not one of them I did.
There was no kind of a director, no style, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting was considered to be seen.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random, round tourists.
My story starts when I was a speech in New York, and my wife made this picture where I hold my first birthday on my arm, and we were on the corner of 57th and fiveth birthday.
So just a year later, we went back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this is going.
When my daughter's third birthday came up to me and said, "Hey, why do you teach Sabina not to New York and do a father-daughter-daughter-daughter-daughter race?"
At the time, we started asking the new tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is, if you take a whole stranger, your camera is enough.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately nobody has ever been tapped with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just taken weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened that day, a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a given moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to think of it in October a week, to stop time and how we change the year and how we're from year to year, not just physically but in everything.
Because although we always make the same picture, our perspective of time changes as it's reached and again, as it's always reaching new milestone, I can see life with its eyes as it deals with everything and how it sees.
And this very intense time that we spend with each other is something we value and expect for every year.
So recently, while one of our trips, we walked for a walk, and all of a sudden it remained as if it were executed, it shows a red mark on a dollboard that she had learned as a little baby, at the previous travel.
And she told me about their feelings that she had thought of as five years of the place.
She said she remembers her heart of the chest when she saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks at high schools in New York because she's really going to go to New York.
And I realized that it was obvious: The most important thing that we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but apart from those 15 pictures, I'm not on a family photo.
I'm always the one who makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come into the picture and tell someone, "Would you like to ask a picture of us?"
Thank you.
